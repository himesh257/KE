WASHINGTON, March 31 \u2014 Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has shown that countries in the Asia Pacific should think about the path into conflict and how it can be avoided, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Wednesday (March 30).\u00a0This meant considering \u201cwhat structures can you build, what processes, what engagements, what strategic accommodations can be made\u201d, so as to head off such a \u201cfailure of deterrence\u201d that would lead to a situation where defence is needed, said Lee during his working trip to the United States.Lee was responding to a question by Richard Haass, president of the Council for Foreign Relations (CFR), a US think tank, on the implications of the Ukraine conflict for Asia Pacific nations.Taking place in between a number of meetings by Lee and US policymakers in America\u2019s capital, the hour-long dialogue was watched by an audience of corporate and governmental leaders in-person and online, who posed wide-ranging questions about geopolitics and US-China relations, nuclear proliferation, climate change and energy security.\u00a0Addressing Haass\u2019 question, Lee\u00a0reiterated several points\u00a0he made during his visit to the White House on\u00a0Tuesday, where he met US President Joe Biden.Condemning Russia\u2019s actions, Lee stressed that that the invasion violates the United Nations Charter and endangers the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, especially small ones.\u201cIf a principle is accepted, that \u2018crazy decisions and historical errors\u2019 are the justification for invading somebody else, I think many of us are going to be feeling very insecure,\u201d said Lee, referring to the reasons given by Russian leader Vladimir Putin for the attack on Ukrainian territory.The global multilateral order of cooperation on issues such as trade, climate change, pandemic preparedness, nuclear non-proliferation, has become very difficult to work due to the conflict.\u201cYou no longer have a framework in which opponents, rivals, competitors, work together and maybe disagree with one another,\u201d he said.\u201cNow it is win-lose, you want the other guy to be down, fix him, crash his economy. So how then do most of the countries, if possible, hang together and cooperate with one another and not fall into disorder, autarky or anarchy?\u201d\u00a0Such a scenario is a \u201cbig worry\u201d for Singapore, because the Republic depends on globalisation to make a living, he said.Lee then noted how various countries have acted in response to the European conflict, with some countries contemplating having nuclear weapons, because \u201cthe implication from Ukraine is that nuclear deterrence is something which can be very valuable\u201d.Calculations will also have to be made for jurisdictions like Taiwan as to which friendly country would come to their help if war were to break out.\u00a0Lee noted growing talk about lengthening Taiwan\u2019s draft national service from four months to a year, as well as polls showing declining confidence among Taiwan residents that America will aid them. \u00a0\u00a0US-China relations\u201cWhat happens in Ukraine is bound to have a big impact on US\u2013China relations It has already strained them,\u201d Lee said.\u201cDespite the best efforts on both sides, and if relations between the US and China worsen, that has a bigger implication for the whole of Asia Pacific and the world.\u201dHaass then asked whether the global response to Russia for its actions in Ukraine has \u201csobered\u201d the Chinese, given the unprecedented sanctions against the aggressor.Lee responded: \u201cI think it presents them with awkward questions. (The Ukraine invasion) violates the principles which the Chinese hold very dearly \u2014 territorial integrity, sovereignty and non-interference.\u201d\u00a0For example, if the Donbas, a region in southeast Ukraine that was recognised by Russia to be an independent republic, can be considered to be enclaves, that could have implications on other non-Han Chinese regions of China, said Lee.The sanctions against Russia have also shown how interrelated countries are. Fracturing these links will hurt both parties, which means that both sides know the price of such a conflict is very high, he said.Giving China space on global stageSome attribute the eastward expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) to be an underlying cause of the conflict. While there is no Nato in Asia, there are hotspots too, said Lee.\u00a0\u201cWe do have issues which are difficult to resolve, and we do need institutions which will bring in countries on both sides.\u201dThis also means having a way to bring \u201crivals\u201d to the table and being able to engage with China and the US, as well as other countries that are closer to one side or the other, he said.\u201cYou have got to move in that direction,\u201d Lee said, adding that there are a number of platforms that are helpful, such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and the East Asia Summit, an annual regional forum of leaders.Lee also gave the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, which is mooted by the US as a way to engage the region on a win-win basis, as another example.Nevertheless, Haass pointed out that there is a widespread view that the decades-long effort to integrate China into global economic institutions largely did not succeed. He said China had \u201ccherry-picked\u201d its involvements and has emerged stronger without moderating its behaviour.Responding, Lee said China\u2019s momentum is enormous and unstoppable, and that past arrangements and concessions for China are no longer \u201cpolitically wearable or economically sensible\u201d.So, adjustments are needed, said Lee, adding that the world has to gradually treat China as a developed economy, and \u201cgive it some space to influence the global system\u201d.\u201cYou do not want to change your whole system of international order, or international law \u2014 this is a framework which everybody fits into. But now you have got a big player and they do want to participate and you have to enable them to participate,\u201d said Lee.\u201cYou can try to block it and hold them back. In which case, maybe you insulate yourself a little bit, but you set up for a troubled relationship for a very long time to come,\u201d he added. \u2014 TODAY",

            "full_description": "On Nov. 28, 2020, Marten Geertsema got a message from a friendly colleague at Columbia University in New York City \u2014 a global seismic tracking network had picked up an anomaly in a remote area on B.C.\u2019s Central Coast. A researcher studying natural hazards at the University of Northern B.C. (UNBC), Geertsema set out to track down what could have caused the earthquake-like signal. \u201cWe were looking within a 50-kilometre radius,\u201d he said. \u201cI looked at all the recent satellite images and stuff and I just couldn't find it.\u201d Two weeks later, wild footage started circulating on social media. A pilot from the Campbell River-based charter and flight school, 49 North Helicopters, had done a flyover of a valley at the head of Bute Inlet. Massive flooding had torn up the land, depositing plums of rock, soil and timber in all directions. \u201cWe kind of put two and two together,\u201d said Geertsema. Last month, Geertsema and his team of researchers finally revealed a terrifying confluence of events in a study published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. Up valley, glaciers that had hung over Elliot Lake for thousands of years have steadily receded with a rise in global temperatures. In one catastrophic moment, slopes the ice had once held together failed, triggering a 50-million tonne landslide \u2014 roughly equal \u201cto the combined mass of all Canadian automobiles,\u201d as the authors put it. More than half of that rock slammed into the two-kilometre-long alpine lake at almost 175 kilometres per hour, triggering a tremor equivalent to a magnitude five earthquake. In an instant, a tsunami climbed more than 100 metres into the air. The initial wave rolled across the lake at over 100 km/h, slamming into and bursting a glacier-deposited dam at the far end. The torrent of water scoured the tributary below, annihilating 8.5 kilometres of salmon-spawning habitat and sending floodwaters and sediment 60 kilometres down the Southgate River. In some parts of the tributary, the floodwaters scoured the channel floor 40 metres deeper. Four minutes later, the up to 50-metre deep floodwaters poured into the sea. Homalco First Nation chief Darren Blaney, on whose traditional territory the event occurred, said his cousin watched rafts of busted up timber nearly 200 metres long and 100 metres wide float into the Bute Inlet , plugging up a whole bay. \u201cLong ago, our people would be up there every fall. My great-grandfather would go up and get about 800 chum, travel over land and sell them to the Squamish,\u201d he said. Blaney says all the spawning ground below the tsunami was basically wiped out. \u201cThe salmon have taken a pretty big hit already. Now, they\u2019re taking another hit with climate change,\u201d said Blaney. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a whole cascade of events that we have to manage so the salmon can try to rebuild.\u201d Blaney says the nation already has a proposal submitted to the federal government for $3.5 million in funding to study and rebuild salmon stocks in the area. And while the chief says he\u2019s worried another landslide could threaten the valley again, it\u2019s far from the only place in B.C. at risk from glacier retreat. \u201cIt's to nobody's surprise that we have introduced enough greenhouse gases into the atmosphere to change the energy balance,\u201d said UNBC glacier expert Brian Menounos, who co-authored the study. \u201cAnd so we know that these glaciers will continue to retreat and that retreat will accelerate really in mid-century, even under moderate emission scenarios.\u201d Since 1900, more than 1,000 glacier lake outbursts have been recorded across the world in places like Alaska, Greenland and the Himalaya. Altogether, they have led to more than 12,500 fatalities, according to the study. In some parts of the world, infrastructure and farmland have paid a heavy toll. To date, none in Western Canada have been lethal to humans. But that could soon change as settlement and tourism creep into alpine areas, warn the researchers. In response, Geertsema and Menounos are part of a growing group of researchers looking to expand risk monitoring in British Columbia\u2019s alpine landscapes. Across many of B.C.\u2019s ice fields, Menounos and colleagues have already mapped the surface of ice fields with lasers beamed from aircraft. That gives them a way to estimate what the ground looks like underneath. As the ice recedes, researchers can then get an early sense of where alpine lakes will form. Combine that information with terrain maps, and Menounos says you can estimate which mountain valleys are most at risk to landslide-triggered flooding. \u201cI think what we're now working towards is sort of a systematic mapping of alpine geohazards,\u201d said Menounos. \u201cThere are some lakes in the Sea to Sky corridor\u2026 there's certainly enough alpine lakes that could pose an issue.\u201d Beyond catastrophic events like the tsunami in Elliot Lake, the slow melting of B.C.'s icy environments has big implications for wildlife and humans. Heat waves like that experienced in June 2021 can melt away seasonal snowfall early in the summer, leaving many watersheds without a cool source of mountain water \u2014 water both people and fish rely on. \u201cAnd then that can be followed by extreme precipitation that can actually cause instability,\u201d Menounos said, pointing to the flooding and landslides that knocked out huge sections of land in the Fraser Canyon last November. \u201cWe're starting to see, not surprisingly, compounding of these individual hazards that taken collectively are greatly affecting infrastructure. And unfortunately, like last November, the loss of life.\u201d",

(UNBC), Geertsema set out to track down what could have caused the earthquake-like signal. \u201cWe were looking within a 50-kilometre radius,\u201d he said. \u201cI looked at all the recent satellite images and stuff and I just couldn't find it.\u201d Two weeks later, wild footage started circulating on social media. A pilot from the Campbell River-based charter and flight school, 49 North Helicopters, had done a flyover of a valley at the head of Bute Inlet. Massive flooding had torn up the land, depositing plums of rock, soil and timber in all directions. \u201cWe kind of put two and two together,\u201d said Geertsema. Last month, Geertsema and his team of researchers finally revealed a terrifying confluence of events in a study published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. Up valley, glaciers that had hung over Elliot Lake for thousands of years have steadily receded with a rise in global temperatures. In one catastrophic moment, slopes the ice had once held together failed, triggering a 50-million tonne landslide \u2014 roughly equal \u201cto the combined mass of all Canadian automobiles,\u201d as the authors put it. More than half of that rock slammed into the two-kilometre-long alpine lake at almost 175 kilometres per hour, triggering a tremor equivalent to a magnitude five earthquake. In an instant, a tsunami climbed more than 100 metres into the air. The initial wave rolled across the lake at over 100 km/h, slamming into and bursting a glacier-deposited dam at the far end. The torrent of water scoured the tributary below, annihilating 8.5 kilometres of salmon-spawning habitat and sending floodwaters and sediment 60 kilometres down the Southgate River. In some parts of the tributary, the floodwaters scoured the channel floor 40 metres deeper. Four minutes later, the up to 50-metre deep floodwaters poured into the sea. Homalco First Nation chief Darren Blaney, on whose traditional territory the event occurred, said his cousin watched rafts of busted up timber nearly 200 metres long and 100 metres wide float into the Bute Inlet , plugging up a whole bay. \u201cLong ago, our people would be up there every fall. My great-grandfather would go up and get about 800 chum, travel over land and sell them to the Squamish,\u201d he said. Blaney says all the spawning ground below the tsunami was basically wiped out. \u201cThe salmon have taken a pretty big hit already. Now, they\u2019re taking another hit with climate change,\u201d said Blaney. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a whole cascade of events that we have to manage so the salmon can try to rebuild.\u201d Blaney says the nation already has a proposal submitted to the federal government for $3.5 million in funding to study and rebuild salmon stocks in the area.

Altogether, they have led to more than 12,500 fatalities, according to the study. In some parts of the world, infrastructure and farmland have paid a heavy toll. To date, none in Western Canada have been lethal to humans. But that could soon change as settlement and tourism creep into alpine areas, warn the researchers. In response, Geertsema and Menounos are part of a growing group of researchers looking to expand risk monitoring in British Columbia\u2019s alpine landscapes. Across many of B.C.\u2019s ice fields, Menounos and colleagues have already mapped the surface of ice fields with lasers beamed from aircraft. That gives them a way to estimate what the ground looks like underneath. As the ice recedes, researchers can then get an early sense of where alpine lakes will form. Combine that information with terrain maps, and Menounos says you can estimate which mountain valleys are most at risk to landslide-triggered flooding. \u201cI think what we're now working towards is sort of a systematic mapping of alpine geohazards,\u201d said Menounos. \u201cThere are some lakes in the Sea to Sky corridor\u2026 there's certainly enough alpine lakes that could pose an issue.\u201d Beyond catastrophic events like the tsunami in Elliot Lake, the slow melting of B.C.'s icy environments has big implications for wildlife and humans. Heat waves like that experienced in June 2021 can melt away seasonal snowfall early in the summer, leaving many watersheds without a cool source of mountain water \u2014 water both people and fish rely on. \u201cAnd then that can be followed by extreme precipitation that can actually cause instability,\u201d Menounos said, pointing to the flooding and landslides that knocked out huge sections of land in the Fraser Canyon last November. \u201cWe're starting to see, not surprisingly, compounding of these individual hazards that taken collectively are greatly affecting infrastructure. And unfortunately, like last November, the loss of life.\u201d",

For the past 100 Fridays, Kathie Schmah and Anne Hanson have stood outside ministers' offices pleading for politicians to take action on climate change. The Mandurah couple were always concerned about climate change but it wasn't until a couple of years ago they hit a tipping point. \"My two daughters have been climate activists all their lives and I've always agreed and admired what they were doing,\" Ms Schmah said. \"But I never really realised the urgency of it until a couple of years ago, and all of a sudden the penny dropped for Anne and myself.\" Deciding to join in the Fridays for Future movement, one day they showed up with placards outside Mandurah's elected state and federal government ministers' offices. Every Friday, they continued to hold climate crisis vigils at politicians' offices across Western Australia. Over time their vigils have grown with other concerned residents and climate action groups joining them. The 100 th vigil saw Australian Conservation Foundation, Extinction Rebellion Grandparents and Grandmothers for Climate Action in attendance.

She said the long term costs of not doing anything were \"horrendous\". \"It could threaten our whole society's future.\" Her plea comes as the federal government handed down its 2022-23 budget , setting aside billions of dollars to deal with the consequences of climate change . Tuesday's federal budget confirmed a $1 billion commitment to protect the Great Barrier Reef, along with funding for research and recycling programs as part of an overall $2.3 billion sector spend. However, the Climate Council said the government's proposed outlay on climate change initiatives is indefensible in the face of the escalating threats Australia is facing. \"Their own documents are showing that climate spending - as a percentage of total budget spending - is just 0.3 per cent for this year and the next two years,\" economist and Climate Council councillor Nicki Hutley said. \"Then it falls to 0.2 per cent which is just totally inadequate and unconscionable.\" Ms Schmah said she couldn't predict where her and Anne would be this Friday but she did know they would be holding placards for Fridays for Future.

The landslide on Nov. 28, 2020, sent 18 million cubic metres of rock cascading down the side of a mountain, uprooting trees and displacing soil before crashing into Elliot Creek, said the study published in Geophysical Research Letters. Earthquake sensors at stations around the world including in Germany, Japan and Australia detected the landslide, the study said. The slide destroyed salmon-spawning habitat over 8.5 kilometres of the creek and sent a plume of mud and organic matter more than 60 kilometres into Bute Inlet, about 150 kilometres from Vancouver, it said. At the same time as the slide, a professor at Columbia University in New York measured a magnitude-5 earthquake in that area. Marten Geertsema, lead author of the paper and adjunct professor at University of Northern British Columbia, said although the landslide wasn\u2019t the largest in Canada, it was \u201cvery, very enormous.\u201d \u201cImagine a landslide with a mass equal to all of the automobiles in Canada travelling with a velocity of about 140 kilometres an hour when it runs into a large lake,\u201d he said in an interview. Geertsema said when the massive slide fell into a lake below, most of the water was drained and forced down a 10-kilometre long channel, causing widespread erosion and loss of salmon habitat. It removed about four million cubic meters of material from the creek within 10 minutes, something that would have taken thousands of years if the stream continued to flow normally, he said. Prof. Brian Menounos, Canada Research Chair in glacier change at University of Northern British Columbia, said several factors came together to cause the slope\u2019s instability and the landslide. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t know is whether the final straw that broke the camel\u2019s back, for lack of a better phrase, was a rainstorm or unusually wet conditions during 2020,\u201d he said. What scientists do know, he said, is that glaciers that once blanketed and held the slopes together are melting at rapid speeds due to human-induced climate change, which leaves the sides of the mountains loose and exposed. Geertsema said the biggest impact of the landslide was on fishing habitat. The Homalco First Nation contributed to the research and its members co-authored the study released last month, bringing their knowledge of Elliot Creek\u2019s salmon habitat, he said. Menounos said landslides are not uncommon and have carved the landscape of continents for millenniums including creating or diverting water bodies and rivers. However, deglaciation is expected to accelerate landslides and, in some cases, scientists have the tools and data to better map the topography beneath glaciers, which allows them to estimate such events, including new lake formations, he said. \u201cThe ability to have perhaps half of the lake volume drained within 10 minutes or less, I mean, it was tremendously powerful and disruptive,\u201d Menounos said. \u201cIt feels very small, studying things with such power.\u201d This report by The Canadian Press was first published March 30, 2022.

            "full_description": "VANCOUVER \u2014 A retreating glacier in a remote British Columbia valley caused a massive landslide that crested a 100-metre tall tsunami, wiped out kilometres of salmon habitat and was detected as far away Australia, a study says. The landslide on Nov. 28, 2020, sent 18 million cubic metres of rock cascading down the side of a mountain, uprooting trees and displacing soil before crashing into Elliot Creek, said the study published in Geophysical Research Letters. Earthquake sensors at stations around the world including in Germany, Japan and Australia detected the landslide, the study said. The slide destroyed salmon-spawning habitat over 8.5 kilometres of the creek and sent a plume of mud and organic matter more than 60 kilometres into Bute Inlet, about 150 kilometres from Vancouver, it said. At the same time as the slide, a professor at Columbia University in New York measured a magnitude-5 earthquake in that area. Marten Geertsema, lead author of the paper and adjunct professor at University of Northern British Columbia, said although the landslide wasn\u2019t the largest in Canada, it was \u201cvery, very enormous.\u201d \u201cImagine a landslide with a mass equal to all of the automobiles in Canada travelling with a velocity of about 140 kilometres an hour when it runs into a large lake,\u201d he said in an interview. Geertsema said when the massive slide fell into a lake below, most of the water was drained and forced down a 10-kilometre long channel, causing widespread erosion and loss of salmon habitat. It removed about four million cubic meters of material from the creek within 10 minutes, something that would have taken thousands of years if the stream continued to flow normally, he said. Prof. Brian Menounos, Canada Research Chair in glacier change at University of Northern British Columbia, said several factors came together to cause the slope\u2019s instability and the landslide. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t know is whether the final straw that broke the camel\u2019s back, for lack of a better phrase, was a rainstorm or unusually wet conditions during 2020,\u201d he said. What scientists do know, he said, is that glaciers that once blanketed and held the slopes together are melting at rapid speeds due to human-induced climate change, which leaves the sides of the mountains loose and exposed. Geertsema said the biggest impact of the landslide was on fishing habitat. The Homalco First Nation contributed to the research and its members co-authored the study released last month, bringing their knowledge of Elliot Creek\u2019s salmon habitat, he said. Menounos said landslides are not uncommon and have carved the landscape of continents for millenniums including creating or diverting water bodies and rivers. However, deglaciation is expected to accelerate landslides and, in some cases, scientists have the tools and data to better map the topography beneath glaciers, which allows them to estimate such events, including new lake formations, he said. \u201cThe ability to have perhaps half of the lake volume drained within 10 minutes or less, I mean, it was tremendously powerful and disruptive,\u201d Menounos said. \u201cIt feels very small, studying things with such power.\u201d This report by The Canadian Press was first published March 30, 2022.

            "full_description": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s climate change plan is built around his theory that Canadians most likely to vote Liberal want him to set tough targets for reducing Canada\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions and then fail to meet them. George Monbiot, one of the world\u2019s leading environmental journalists, described what Trudeau is doing in the Canadian edition of his 2006 book Heat: How To Stop the Planet From Burning. He said in \u201crich\u201d countries of the world, like Canada, \u201cour response will be to demand that the government act, while hoping that it doesn\u2019t. We will wish our governments to pretend to act. We get the moral satisfaction of saying what we know to be right, without the discomfort of doing it. \u201cMy fear is that the political parties in most rich nations have already recognized this.\u201d The latest Liberal climate change plan released by Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault on Tuesday is a manifesto of pretending to act. The Trudeau government, which has presided over an increase of Canada\u2019s emissions by seven million tonnes annually from 2015 to 2019, now claims it can lower them by up to 324 million tonnes and by at least 287 million tonnes by 2030. Trudeau\u2019s minimum target would mean cutting emissions equivalent to Canada\u2019s entire oil and gas sector (191.4 million tonnes in 2019) and building sector (90.7 million tonnes) by 2030. His maximum target would mean cutting emissions equivalent to Canada\u2019s entire oil and gas sector (191.4 million tonnes), agriculture sector (72.7 million tonnes) and electricity sector (61.1 million tonnes). In Guibeault\u2019s plan released Tuesday, Trudeau claims Canada is on track so far to lower emissions by 36.4% by 2030 \u2014 slightly below his minimum target \u2014 by cutting 77% of emissions in the electricity sector; 43% in the \u201cwaste and others\u201d sector including coal production, light manufacturing, construction and forest resources; 42% in the oil and gas sector; 42% in the buildings sector; 32% in the heavy industry sector and 23% in the transportation sector. This is in a report that revealed, according to the government\u2019s own figures, that Trudeau failed to achieve his 2020 target of cutting emissions to 30% below 2005 levels by 61 million tonnes, consistent with nine consecutive failures to achieve emission cuts promised by federal Liberal and Conservative governments going back to 1988. Paying for these failures hasn\u2019t come cheap, with the Trudeau government boasting last year it has invested $100 billion fighting climate change since 2015. To help pay for all this, Trudeau imposed a carbon tax on four Canadian provinces with more than 50% of the country\u2019s population \u2014 Ontario, Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan \u2014 beginning in 2019 because, he said, their plans to lower emissions were insufficient to meet the federal standard. The federal government insists this tax leaves 80% of Canadian families who pay it better off financially through carbon tax rebates, a claim it continued to make while revealing its latest plan this week, even though Parliament\u2019s independent, non-partisan budgetary officer said last week that in reality, 60% of families are paying more in carbon taxes than they get in rebates, which will rise to 80% in Ontario by 2024 and in Alberta by 2028. In other words, in Canada more than half the country is paying a federal sin tax for using fossil fuel energy to maintain the fiction we are reducing emissions to levels we won\u2019t achieve, while the rest of the country is paying provincial sin taxes to do the same.",

That\u2019s based on data about Saskatchewan that Environment and Climate Change Canada never shows us, based on data collected in Ottawa about oil and gas sites they\u2019ve never visited,\u201d she said. \u201cIt comes to be about divide and conquer.\u201d Eyre said the provincial government plans to submit its own data, and then hash it out from there. \u201cWe\u2019re going to submit numbers with made-in-Saskatchewan data, and (the feds can) tell us why we can\u2019t and how they\u2019re wrong. Because it is very difficult to establish here where any of this (data from the federal government) is really coming from,\u201d she said. If that doesn\u2019t work out, she said her government simply won\u2019t comply. \u201cWe feel that, increasingly, this should be a quid pro quo. You impose caps on us and tell us exactly what numbers you\u2019re using and show us your data or we\u2019re not co-operating,\u201d Eyre declared. She\u2019s also not happy with the level of communication from the federal government. \u201cI can tell you that (consultation) is not happening \u2026 They talk about talking to provinces. Saskatchewan energy officials have had one 30-minute call with federal officials. One time. That\u2019s it,\u201d she said.",

            "content": "ShutterstockTomorrow\u2019s minimum wage increase to NZ$21.20 an hour should help a significant number of New Zealand\u2019s lowest paid workers and their families \u2013 300,000 people, according to the government. Just how much it will help, however, is less certain. At 6%, the increase is in line with with the 5.9% annual rise in the consumer price index (CPI) in the December 2021 quarter. But inflation is still rising, with domestic and global pressures meaning it\u2019s likely to keep rising for some time. Those minimum wage gains, along with simultaneous increases to other benefits and superannuation payments, are already eroding. The food price index rose 6.8% in February from the previous year. International commodity and oil prices have soared since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Some estimates suggest an annual CPI rise of between 7% and 8% in this year\u2019s March quarter. It\u2019s clear low-income households will continue to struggle to keep pace with the rising cost of living. For that reason, the minimum wage increase must be accompanied by other support measures, and not viewed as a solution in its own right. Minimum wages and employment In fact, there are those who don\u2019t see a minimum wage as being productive at all. One school of economic thought proposes that minimum wages actually undermine job creation by making employers avoid paying for more expensive labour at the same time as encouraging more workers into the job market. This view was articulated by Nobel laureate economist George Stigler, who wrote in 1976: One evidence of professional integrity of the economist is the fact that it is not possible to enlist good economists to defend protectionist programs or minimum wage laws. Read more: Does raising the minimum wage kill jobs? The centurylong search for the elusive answer shows why economics is so difficult \u2013 but data sure helps But other economists have argued against this \u2013 for example, David Card and Alan Krueger, who published several controversial empirical works in the 1990s finding increasing the minimum wage doesn\u2019t necessarily lead to fewer jobs. Not everyone agrees with Card and Krueger, however. David Neumark and William Wascher evaluated the evidence and argued minimum wages do reduce employment opportunities for less skilled workers, \u201cespecially those who are most directly affected by minimum wage\u201d. So, there is no real academic consensus on minimum wages \u2013 and not even much agreement on what the research literature really says. Effects on poverty Given all this, perhaps the better question is whether minimum-wage policies reduce poverty overall. But again, the research has been contradictory. In one New Zealand study in 2012, researchers found minimum wages do not guarantee people will escape poverty. Another study using Irish data also concluded that minimum wages may be \u201ca blunt instrument\u201d for tackling poverty. Read more: New Zealand's health restructure is doomed to fall short unless its funding model is tackled first On the other hand, a 2021 US study found significant positive employment effects for single mothers with aged children five and under, suggesting minimum wages at least have potential as a policy instrument for reducing child poverty. This is particularly relevant in New Zealand for two reasons: one in five M\u0101ori children and one in four Pasifika children meet the criteria for material hardship, and Pacific people and M\u0101ori represent 10% and 20% of minimum wage earners, respectively. Minimum wage just one tool What does seem clear is that minimum wage policies are most effective as part of a complementary income support bundle, as some overseas research has shown and which was supported by a comprehensive review of minimum wage policies in New Zealand. Examining the effects on various economic outcomes since 2000, the authors argued that minimum wage policies should be \u201cdesigned and evaluated in the context of other income support policies\u201d. Those other supports include the Families Package introduced in 2018, which included an increase to the accommodation supplement, designed to help low income earners with rent, board or mortgages (but is not available to those in public housing). Read more: No silver lining for climate change: pain at the petrol pump will do little to get us out of our cars The same authors recently investigated the impact of increases in the maximum accommodation supplement rates to see if these had simply been swallowed by rising accommodation costs. Their findings were encouraging: more than 90% of the increase in assistance was captured by the recipients as an increase in after-rent income. A minimum wage policy has a greater chance of success when coupled with successful support policies such as this. But it\u2019s important such complementary policies are synchronised, especially given only some other social policies, such as Working for Families, are inflation-adjusted. Read more: The pandemic exposes NZ\u2019s supply chain vulnerability \u2013 be ready for more inflation in the year ahead Getting the mix right Elsewhere, these policy combinations have been effective. In the United States, for example, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) \u2013 as its title suggests, a refundable tax credit similar to New Zealand\u2019s Working for Families policy \u2013 has been shown to benefit low-wage workers and families in combination with a modest increase in the minimum wage. Again, the combination of policies works better than either in isolation, and some recent studies suggest EITC expansions and minimum wage hikes should be thought of in tendem as complementary policies. However, one of the big challenges of integrating minimum wage settings with other policies is that each tool affects many economic outcomes. What should be the optimal level of minimum wages? How do minimum wage hikes interact with other supporting policies? While there have been some official efforts to measure the relationship between the minimum wage and other state interventions, this needs to go further in order to find the right policy mix \u2013 especially during a year that will see continued high inflation, low growth and economic uncertainty.

I must say this surprised me as I understand that in other countries like UK and India, there is the same charge for both types of milk and I would like to politely request that you consider this policy also in Starbucks USA. My friends at PETA are campaigning for this to happen and I have agreed to support them with the quote: \u201cSir Paul is asking Starbucks to end its surcharge on plant milks,\u201d and I sincerely hope that for the future of the planet and animal welfare you are able to implement this policy. Many thanks. All the Best, Sir Paul McCartney",

Priya Shukla Contributor Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Science I write about the ocean, climate change, and the future of our planet. Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Representative photo of the coral tanks after 22 months of exposure to \"current\" ocean conditions. Rowan McLachlan, OSU College of Science A study spanning nearly two years suggests that some Hawaiian corals may tolerate warming and ocean acidification more than previously thought. Understanding how corals respond to climate-related stressors is becoming increasingly urgent, especially as the Great Barrier Reef is currently grappling with yet another mass coral bleaching event - its fourth one since 2016. Coral bleaching has also occurred in Hawai\u2019i. For example, reefs under protection from the state suffered ongoing bleaching for multiple years in Hanauma Bay, with nearly half the corals become bleached. During these bleaching events, stressed corals eject the photosynthetic algae that live within them that they depend on for food. While corals can recover these zooxanthellae, consistently bleached corals are less able to do so. Since Hawaiian reefs may deal with lingering environmental challenges, longer-term studies are quite valuable. \u201cThe majority of research that has been done investigating the capacity for coral reefs to survive and persist under ocean warming and acidification has been gained from short-term experiments, one-month duration on average, based in indoor laboratories in empty glass tanks,\u201d says lead author, Rowan McLachlan, \u201cWhile informative, these studies are limited in their ability to predict how coral will respond in the wild where the environment is much more complex.\u201d Representative photo of the coral tanks after 22 months of exposure to \"future\" ocean conditions. Rowan McLachlan, OSU College of Science MORE FOR YOU New Research Finds A Connection Between Domestic Violence And These Two Personality Disorders This Scientist Helps Andean Forests And Ecuador\u2019s Women In STEM Exceptional Fossil Preservation Suggests That Discovering Dinosaur DNA May Not Be Impossible During the 22-month project, researchers collected samples of three of the most common Hawaiian coral species and placed them in tanks with different seawater temperature and acidity levels that signify present and future oceanic conditions. At the end, the study showed that more of the corals that experienced warmer waters did perish, but 61 percent of them still survived. A branching finger coral species known as Porites was especially tolerant of ocean warming and acidification, with 71 percent of the corals surviving after almost two years had elapsed. As key components of Hawaiian coral reefs, their resilience may help sustain some ocean biodiversity within Hawai\u2019i. \u201cOur study found that in the absence of local stressors such as nutrient pollution, overfishing, bottom trawling, physical damage from tourism, etc., at least half of Hawaiian reef corals will be able to survive and persist in up to 22 months exposure to ocean warming and acidification,\u201d said McLachlan, \u201cThe results provide hope that if we can mitigate climate change and keep within the targets of the Paris Climate Agreement, coral reefs will persist in some form.\u201d Follow me on Twitter .

What can people expect from Seven Worlds, One Planet Live In Concert? I\u2019m not the narrator so it will still have Sir David Attenborough\u2019s glorious dulcet tones on it. I will be providing the connections as a live storyteller. It\u2019s in the O2 on a giant screen and it\u2019s the best wildlife footage that\u2019s ever been made, accompanied by live music from an 80-piece orchestra and a choir. There is a very strong chance I might cry on stage. Have you become more emotional since becoming a dad? Definitely. But probably some of that is sleeplessness \u2014 we slept about two hours last night because the kids were up. But I\u2019m an emotional person anyway. I get very swelled by music, particularly orchestral music. And obviously wildlife is the thing that\u2019s driven me through my entire life. So those two things combined is a pretty intoxicating combination. Do you know Sir David Attenborough well? I\u2019d love to say I know him well but it\u2019d be taking things too far. I\u2019ve been lucky enough to work with him on several occasions and everyone looks up to him with good reason. He\u2019s the greatest storyteller I\u2019ve ever met. I was at the centennial anniversary of the Wildlife Trust in the Natural History Museum, and myself and other naturalists spoke with our collections of slides and films, all highly practised to within an inch of its life. Sir David came on stage without any notes and talked for an hour completely off the top of his head. Several hundred hardened conservationists sat enraptured. Nobody wanted to go for a wee. Do you watch his shows with your children? We try not to watch too much television because they\u2019re still young but what we do watch usually has an educational element to it. Some of the very first TV Logan watched was Sir David\u2019s work and the rest is mostly mine! He really likes Deadly 60. Amazingly, the twins really like it as well. Bo, our little girl, will wander around the house going \u2018Deadly 60, Daddy!\u2019 They\u2019re really into it. I\u2019m sure that won\u2019t last. Aren\u2019t they confused about you being on the telly? They get confused if we\u2019re out in public and somebody wants a photo taken with me. But they have seen both Helen [Glover, Steve\u2019s Olympic rower wife] and me on telly from the first time they watched one so they probably think everybody\u2019s mum and dad are. Has having children affected you going away so much? We had rules that we were intending on sticking to but then the pandemic hit. I\u2019d said I wasn\u2019t going to do anything more than two-week trips then be home for two weeks but you don\u2019t get to make those decisions now. How did Covid-19 affect you? I did lots of filming from home during the first lockdown. But then things started again and travelling during the peak of the pandemic was stressful. The alternative was that we shut down the production company we work for so we all clubbed together and threw ourselves into it. Steve rarely gets scared of animals while working with them (Picture: BBC) I did six expeditions to Saudi Arabia, Gabon, Mexico, all over the place, plus a full series on sharks travelling all over the globe. There were some hairy moments. In what sense hairy? When we were in Gabon there was a curfew imposed and the capital city was closed off from the rest of the country while we were out in the sticks filming gorillas. We had to get out of the country to do the next expedition so we drove at top speed 10 hours across the country to find the city barricaded in. We had to find a way down side streets with a police guard, which was so scary. Then, in Saudi Arabia, we were on the plane to fly home for Christmas when the country shut down and stayed shut down for three months. If we\u2019d left two hours later, we\u2019d have been stuck in an airport hotel for that time.

CEO Bob Iger , who makes the case for why corporate leaders should wade into major issues like climate change, immigration and, most recently, Florida \u2019s so-called \u2018don\u2019t say gay\u2019 bill. \u201cA lot of these issues are not necessarily political,\u201d Iger said in the interview, which will stream this week. \u201cIt\u2019s about right and wrong. So I happened to feel, and I tweeted an opinion about the \u2018don\u2019t say gay\u2019 bill in Florida. To me, it wasn\u2019t about politics. It is about what is right and what is wrong, and that just seemed wrong. It seemed potentially harmful to kids.\u201d Disney, now led by Iger\u2019s successor Bob Chapek , this week issued a statement condemning the Florida legislation, which was signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis. But Chapek was initially reluctant to take a public side on the legislation, saying that corporate statements often are \u201cweaponized by one side or the other to further divide and inflame.\u201d But the company\u2019s public silence triggered a backlash, Chapek went public with the company\u2019s opposition and acknowledged that \u201cour original approach, no matter how well intentioned, didn\u2019t quite get the job done.\u201d Related Story Ron DeSantis Says Disney \"Crossed A Line\" In Opposing Florida's 'Don't Say Gay' Bill; Claims Company Never Called Legislative Leader About Bill - Update In the interview with Wallace, Iger talked of going public on issues like climate change and immigration. \u201cI had to contend with this a lot, and the filter that I used to determine whether we should or should not weigh in considered a few factors. What would its impact have on our employees, on our shareholders and our customers? And if any one of those three constituencies had a deep interest in or would be affected by whatever was the matter at hand, then it was something I thought we should consider weighing in on.\u201d Wallace asked Iger whether there was consideration given to the fact that \u201cwhether it\u2019s right or wrong,\u201d he was \u201cgoing to tick off people, whether it is on climate change or immigration or gender identity. There are going to be people who aren\u2019t going to like what [you] are saying and maybe that means fewer people will come to the theme park.\u201d \u201cWe never really saw much evidence of that, even though there were threats about boycotts on certain things,\u201d Iger replied. \u201cAgain, when you are dealing with right and wrong, and when you are dealing with something that does have a profound impact on your business, I just think you have to do what is right and not worry about the potential backlash to it.\u201d In another part of the interview, Wallace played a clip from the documentary The American Dream and Other Fairy Tales , co-directed by Abigail Disney, which takes The Walt Disney Co. to task for the wide disparity in pay between hourly theme park workers and Iger\u2019s CEO compensation. The movie argues that a significant number of Disneyland employees are on food stamps or even homeless. Wallace asked, \u201cYou were making that year 1,000 times what the average Disney employee was making. Do you have any misgivings about that?\u201d Iger responded, \u201cI\u2019ve never been defensive about what I made. I was paid at a level that was commensurate with what most heads of large media companies were paid throughout my tenure and often less than, interestingly enough, and Disney was among the most complex and the largest and the most successful of them all.\u201d He said that \u201cwe created many more jobs, particularly in the United States, during my tenure. And we gave people many more opportunities over that period of time.\u201d He also said that many of those who received minimum wage \u201cearned overtime, got good benefits and were promoted over time as well.\u201d He noted that they started a program to pick up the cost of workers\u2019 education. \u201cIf I have regrets, it would be one, and that is that, we were one of the first companies, by the way, to go to $10 an hour as the starting wage,\u201d Iger said. \u201cWe were being pushed to go to 15. There was some hesitation in that regard because of the cost associated with it. We should have done that right away. My opinion.\u201d The CNN+ series Who\u2019s Talking To Chris Wallace? is first shown at 6 PM ET then available on demand.",

            "full_description": "This year's federal budget is characterised by an avalanche of immediate handouts in response to cost-of-living pressures, some sound initiatives and deferral of more fundamental decisions. This is precisely reflected in how the budget treats energy and climate change. The A$1 billion to expand Australia's low emission technology capabilities, such as green hydrogen, is welcome. But cuts to the fuel excise represent poor policy on fiscal and environmental grounds. From the devastating bushfires of 2019-2020 to this year's shocking floods, unprecedented climate-related disasters have wrought havoc across Australia. It is deeply regretful that the budget and forward estimates do not specifically recognise the ongoing, and escalating, scale and the fiscal impact of these disasters. Fuel excise is poor policy For six months, the government will halve fuel excise to 22.1 cents per litre to offset soaring petrol prices. This short-term reduction will undoubtedly be welcomed by anyone with a petrol or diesel vehicle, and may provide the sort of political boost the government seeks ahead of the election. Yet, it is poor fiscal policy. First, the outlook for global oil prices is as unpredictable as the outcome of the Ukraine war. That means the cut in fuel excise will quickly be either too strong a response or insufficient. Second, restoring the level will not be politically simple. As a relief for households under financial stress, the measure is poorly targeted. It is also a stark illustration of how motorists today would already be financially better off if Treasurer Josh Frydenberg was able to implement his proposed fuel efficiency standards in 2017 , when he was the minister for energy and the environment. At that time, the benefit to motorists was calculated to be more than $500 per year by 2025\u2014and that was based on prices below $1.50 per litre, well short of current levels above $2. And of course, we would have been making tangible progress on reducing emissions in the transport sector. Funding low-emissions technologies Development and deployment of low-emission technologies\u2014such as clean hydrogen, green steel and carbon capture and storage\u2014will be critical to meeting Australia's commitment to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The government's commitment of more than $1 billion to projects to support these technologies is welcome, as is the allocation of $84 million to support the development of microgrids. These investments are generally aligned with the government's technology investment roadmap , released in 2020. However, it would be better for these projects to be selected via an independent agency with criteria set by the government. The government emphasises a \"technology, not taxes\" approach to bringing Australia's emissions to net zero. But funding the net-zero transition from government coffers is not sustainable. We need policies such as a price on carbon that encourage the market to deploy these technologies at scale. The recent history of such policies in Australia means this will be a big challenge for whoever is energy minister after the looming federal election. Australia's extensive renewable energy and critical minerals resources mean we could be a global leader in manufacturing, for instance, downstream processing or iron ore, copper, lithium and similar metals critical in a low emissions world. So the $1 billion in the budget to boost our manufacturing capability is another step in the right direction. But again, good governance should include a clear framework that determines which projects get selected. This process should be based primarily on Australia's potential competitive advantage. The primary source of such advantage lies in our renewable energy and minerals resources, while specific regions may also have advantages based on existing infrastructure such as ports and skilled workforces. Investments in low-emission technologies and manufacturing is closely aligned with this budget's focus on Australia's regions. Investment in new opportunities will be welcomed in the regions. It should be accompanied by an equally strong commitment to working with regional communities that may suffer job losses and other economic harms in the transition away from fossil fuel industries. Short-term climate thinking Frydenberg's budget acknowledged the devastation wrought in Australia by floods, drought and bushfires. Yet it failed to acknowledge the future cost of such disasters on the budget under climate change . The budget includes measures to make regional Australia more resilient, to mitigate the impact of these disasters and support insurance coverage. But these are short-term commitments. Even if we manage to stop global warming beyond 1.5\u2103 this century, the frequency and severity of natural disasters will only worsen. Australia is already feeling the damage. The economic and fiscal consequences of these disasters will only increase. And there will be other risks from a changing climate such as rising health spending and reduced government revenues from key exports, including liquefied natural gas. So what should the government do differently? At the very least, the federal government should move to better understand and quantify the fiscal risks from climate change . First, it should include some of the immediate risks of climate change in the budget's \"Statement of Risks\", which outlines the general fiscal risks that may affect the budget. Second, it should adjust medium-term fiscal projection models to factor in declining revenue from fossil fuels, higher cost of debt, and higher expenditure on health and natural disaster supports. Third, the longer-term impacts of climate change on the budget must be modelled. This should inform the next Intergenerational Report in 2025, which provides an economic outlook for Australia over coming decades. Climate change ultimately challenges governments to reconsider their fiscal strategy. The many climate-related uncertainties make a strong case for preserving fiscal flexibility and firepower to cushion the direct impacts of climate change, including natural disasters.

            "full_description": "Since Russia began its latest invasion of Ukraine, our region has been on heightened alert for signs that the Kremlin\u2019s offensive might embolden Beijing in its pursuit of regional and global dominance. The draft agreement between China and the government of Solomon Islands revealed last Thursday and later verified by the Australian government will be seen as Beijing\u2019s first test of changed geopolitical waters. It has already prompted some to urge a dramatic reassessment of our relations with Honiara: writing for The Age , Professor Anne-Marie Brady said it was time to set aside niceties about sovereignty and admit that \u201cSolomon Islands is a failed state\u201d. Elsewhere, publisher David Llewellyn-Smith said this was \u201cAustralia\u2019s Cuban missile crisis\u201d and that the federal government should \u201c engineer regime change in Honiara \u201d, later suggesting iron ore sales to China should be suspended if the agreement is signed. As George Megalogenis pointed out last week , while sanctions against Russian oligarchs might carry relatively minor costs for Australia, sanctions against China and its leaders would be budget-altering. Iron ore accounts for almost 40 per cent of our merchandise exports to the world. The Morrison government has responded with a number of soothing formulas. First it regularly refers to Pacific island nations as our \u201cfamily\u201d, then it points to the \u201c Pacific step-up \u201d as a sign that it is increasingly engaged with the region and reminds us that Australia accounts for 45 per cent of the development funding given to these nations, with \u201cdaylight to second\u201d, as Prime Minister Scott Morrison puts it. It\u2019s noteworthy, though, that he still has not dispatched Foreign Minister Marise Payne to make her representations. The question is, what kind of family is this? Are the Pacific island nations our children, or our siblings? Attempts to prevail upon our relationships with Fiji and Papua New Guinea and see the leadership of the Solomons change course appear to have failed. But can our Prime Minister really take a more coercive approach without undermining his commitment \u2013 which is also Washington\u2019s \u2013 to a \u201c free and open Indo-Pacific ... [where] individual countries will be able to choose their own path and their own partners\u201d, as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken put it in Jakarta in December ? It would be a fraught path for Australia to point out to Honiara our aid contribution or our role in restoring security after last November\u2019s riots in any discussions over Solomons\u2019 foreign policy. When prime minister Tony Abbott tried to use our aid to tsunami-stricken Indonesia as leverage in pleading for Australian drug smugglers Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran to be spared, it sparked widespread condemnation, the \u201ccoins for Abbott\u201d backlash , and changed nothing. To talk about quantity of aid misses an important point. Solomon Islands and other Pacific nations have for decades been accustomed to foreign powers \u2013 and particularly Taiwan and China \u2013 seeking to influence them through \u201cchequebook diplomacy\u201d. In turn, politicians from these nations have become adept at turning local and global conflicts to their financial advantage. This is where the quality of aid, and of our relationships, becomes critical. We could certainly accuse Beijing of supporting the interests of Solomons Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare and his supporters. But have we been an effective counterweight to possible corruption and to resource exploitation? Have we given all parties in the Solomons reason to look to us as a partner? Or have we, as some Solomon Islanders contend , shored up a rotten political structure and vied with China to duchess the nation\u2019s political class? Canberra\u2019s hopes of persuading Honiara not to sign the agreement with Beijing already seem to be extinguished. That only makes it more essential that we take a hard look at our long-term aims in the region \u2013 what deputy Labor leader Richard Marles has called our \u201cintent\u201d \u2013 and spell these out to our \u201cfamily\u201d. It is not enough to talk about a \u201cstep-up\u201d. We need to be on the same ground with the Pacific nations, inviting them on the journey, spelling out collective goals, talking with them and listening to their responses. We should, as a priority, be prepared to give these small and increasingly impoverished countries and their populations a stake and a voice in the big decisions on climate change and national security. And we should start today by dispatching our Foreign Minister. Without that, how seriously can we be taken? Gay Alcorn sends an exclusive newsletter to subscribers each week.

            "content": "Locals are suffering the polluting consequences of the dump (Picture: Michael Quezada) Around 39,000 tons of fast fashion was dumped in Chile\u2019s Atacama Desert just last year, according to a new study. Sum of Us, a non-profit advocacy organisation that aims to \u2018hold large corporations to account\u2019 on issues such as climate change, corruption and workers rights, found that an enormous amount of clothes are piling up in \u2018micro-dumps\u2019, which could be having a huge impact on the environment and local communities. H&M and Adidas were among the brands with the most clothes left to build up in the world\u2019s driest desert. The build up of toxic waste, which is either left to rot or burned, was also found to be having a profound effect on local residents, some of whom are the poorest in the Alto Hospicio region. From pollution to pests, locals are suffering the worst consequences of the tons of fast fashion being dumped on their doorstep. How do these clothes end up in Chile? Every year, around 59,000 tons of secondhand and unsold clothing, often made in China or Bangladesh, reaches Chile \u2013 Latin America\u2019s biggest importer of secondhand clothing \u2013 after passing through Europe, Asia or the United States.\u00a0 The clothes are sent to the Iquique port in the Alto Hospicio free zone in northern Chile.\u00a0From there, around 15% of the clothes are resold around Latin America, according to Alto Hospicio mayor, Patricio Ferreira. The leftover 85%, however, is left in the free zone.\u00a0 Angela Astudillo, a local Iquique resident and coordinator of local activist group Desierto Vestido (which translates to desert dress in English), tells Metro.co.uk that the clothes are categorised into \u2018first, second and third selection.\u2019 \u2018These [clothes] are sold to different boutiques and stores that sell this type of clothing here in Iquique and are also sold abroad in Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, where they enter illegally since they have policies that prohibit the entry of such clothes,\u2019 she said. \u2018The problem starts because there are many clothes that come with broken details, so these clothes must be selected again and this is where the discarding of clothes occurs.\u2019 \u2018Mountains of waste\u2019 left in the world\u2019s driest desert (Picture: Michael Quezada) Among the clothes are old tyres, plastics, wires and other rubbish (Picture: Michael Quezada) Any clothes that can\u2019t be categorised into either first, second or third selection are left as rubbish.\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018As there is no final disposal for this waste, it ends up dumped not only in this landfill but also in different parts of the municipality, which then become like micro-dumps,\u2019 Astudillo adds. Due to the fact that these clothes are made from synthetic materials and chemical products, meaning they are not biodegradable and take more than 200 years to decompose, municipal dumps won\u2019t accept the clothes, so they\u2019re left piling up in the desert, ten minutes away from the city of Iquique.\u00a0 Although, Astudillo noted, there are companies that attempt to dispose of the waste properly, people often aren\u2019t willing to pay the fees associated with this, and one small company that recycles the fabric, EcoFibra, can\u2019t cope with the \u2018mountains of waste that is produced.\u2019 H&M and Adidas among the most dumped clothing Sum of Us sent a small team to investigate the dumping ground in a bid to find out which brands were the biggest culprits. \u2018Given the enormity of the piles of clothing found in the Atacama Desert, it was impossible to sort through it all, so samples were taken at different locations in the dumping grounds,\u2019 Sum of Us said.\u00a0 \u2018Within one hour of sorting through the clothing, many of the most world renowned fashion brands were discovered.\u2019 {\"@context\":\"https:\\/\\/schema.org\",\"@type\":\"VideoObject\",\"name\":\"Metro.co.uk\",\"duration\":\"T1M8S\",\"thumbnailUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/i.dailymail.co.uk\\/1s\\/2022\\/03\\/29\\/12\\/55950471-0-image-a-1_1648554920282.jpg\",\"uploadDate\":\"2022-03-29T12:52:46+0100\",\"description\":\"Global fashion brands are dumping perfectly good clothes in Chile.\",\"contentUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/videos.metro.co.uk\\/video\\/met\\/2022\\/03\\/29\\/8934410406323768862\\/480x270_MP4_8934410406323768862.mp4\",\"height\":270,\"width\":480} To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Its investigation found that Old Navy made up most of the brands they discovered, followed by H&M, Adidas and Levi\u2019s. Other brands included Zara, Hugo Boss, Under Armour, Tommy Hilfiger, Nike and many more. The investigative team encountered a great deal of second-hand clothing, as well as clothing that was completely new, some even with price tags still attached.\u00a0 \u2018Though these fashion brands are not dumping clothing in the Atacama directly, the industry\u2019s overproduction and its dirty supply chains make them complicit,\u2019 Sum of Us added. Clothes, new with tags on, can be found at the dump (Picture: Michael Quezada) A spokesperson for H&M told Metro.co.uk: \u2018We take this matter extremely seriously and immediately started an investigation to make sure that our own strict waste disposal and recycling processes were followed by all our partners.\u00a0 \u2018Based on the outcome of this investigation, we do not hold any connection to this area and to deposit clothing in nature certainly goes against what we and our sustainability efforts stand for. However, the report clearly shows that textile recycling is still an industry-wide challenge, regardless of brand or charity organisation.\u00a0 \u2018There is still no developed infrastructure to collect textiles at end of use.\u00a0 \u2018To truly be able to change the system we need to scale circular business models and textile to textile recycling.\u00a0 \u2018H&M Group works actively to change the system and find scalable solutions that will help us steer this low value re-use towards recycling instead.\u2019 Adidas told Metro.co.uk: \u2018Adidas ensures proper disposal of waste across the company and does not dump products. \u2018To avoid waste we are increasing the use of recycled materials.\u00a0By 2024, Adidas will only use recycled polyester, already today we are at more than 90%.\u00a0 \u2018Adidas is also working on taking back more and more used products to repurpose materials.\u00a0 \u2018In the US, we launched a comprehensive takeback program in September 2021. Additional markets will follow this year.\u2019 Old Navy, Levi\u2019s, Zara, Hugo Boss, Under Armour, Tommy Hilfiger and Nike have been contacted by Metro.co.uk, but are yet to respond. Locals are suffering the consequences The clothes are sent in large garbage bales, along with shoes, plastics, wires, wallets, household, cardboard and other rubbish, to the clothing dump. Beyond the dump, residents of the Alto Hospicio region are dealing with porter trucks driving through the area to dump the waste, causing pollution and soil contamination.\u00a0 She added that the dump attracts \u2018vectors\u2019 (disease-carrying insects, like tics) to the local area. \u2018When they burn these clothes, all of this contamination affects the people who live here.\u2019 SumOfUs investigated the site to find out which brands were the main culprits (Picture: Michael Quezada) Closer to the dumping ground, locals are dealing with even worse conditions.\u00a0 According to SumOfUs and Desierto Vestido, around 1,000 of the most impoverished people in Chile live on or near to the actual dumping grounds. \u2018The residents live off the clothes,\u2019 Astudillo said. \u2018But they only separate clothes they plan to resell and throw away or burn the rest.\u2019 One local resident who lives just outside of the dumping ground, who wanted to remain anonymous, told Metro.co.uk: \u2018Those of us who live in these houses are mainly affected by the infection that is created by the accumulation of this waste and the plague of rats it brings.\u00a0 \u2018Every time there is a fire, it takes days to burn out and, for some people, the smoke causes allergic reactions, respiratory difficulties or vomiting.\u00a0 \u2018We cannot go anywhere else \u2013 this is where we live and we are in an extremely precarious situation.\u00a0 \u2018Everyday we are at risk that there will be another fire and that our families will suffer the consequences.\u2019 Around 1,000 of Alto Hospicio\u2019s poorest residents live a stone\u2019s throw away from the dumping ground (Picture: Michael Quezada) Laura Krasovitzky, of SumOfUs, said: \u2018While the last few months brought media coverage to how the Atacama Desert has turned into a fast fashion dump, no one talked about the companies involved in this dirty supply chain.\u00a0 \u2018At SumOfUs, we wanted to shine a light on the biggest corporate culprits contributing to this environmental disaster so we sent an investigative team that not only confirmed our suspicions on how some of the world\u2019s most well-known fashion brands were present in the desert, but also unveiled how close the dump site is to local communities.

From there, around 15% of the clothes are resold around Latin America, according to Alto Hospicio mayor, Patricio Ferreira. The leftover 85%, however, is left in the free zone. Angela Astudillo, a local Iquique resident and coordinator of local activist group Desierto Vestido (which translates to desert dress in English), tells Metro.co.uk that the clothes are categorised into \u2018first, second and third selection.\u2019 \u2018These [clothes] are sold to different boutiques and stores that sell this type of clothing here in Iquique and are also sold abroad in Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, where they enter illegally since they have policies that prohibit the entry of such clothes,\u2019 she said. \u2018The problem starts because there are many clothes that come with broken details, so these clothes must be selected again and this is where the discarding of clothes occurs.\u2019 Any clothes that can\u2019t be categorised into either first, second or third selection are left as rubbish. \u2018As there is no final disposal for this waste, it ends up dumped not only in this landfill but also in different parts of the municipality, which then become like micro-dumps,\u2019 Astudillo adds. Due to the fact that these clothes are made from synthetic materials and chemical products, meaning they are not biodegradable and take more than 200 years to decompose, municipal dumps won\u2019t accept the clothes, so they\u2019re left piling up in the desert, ten minutes away from the city of Iquique. Although, Astudillo noted, there are companies that attempt to dispose of the waste properly, people often aren\u2019t willing to pay the fees associated with this, and one small company that recycles the fabric, EcoFibra, can\u2019t cope with the \u2018mountains of waste that is produced.\u2019 Sum of Us sent a small team to investigate the dumping ground in a bid to find out which brands were the biggest culprits. \u2018Given the enormity of the piles of clothing found in the Atacama Desert, it was impossible to sort through it all, so samples were taken at different locations in the dumping grounds,\u2019 Sum of Us said. \u2018Within one hour of sorting through the clothing, many of the most world renowned fashion brands were discovered.\u2019 To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Its investigation found that Old Navy made up most of the brands they discovered, followed by H&M, Adidas and Levi\u2019s. Other brands included Zara, Hugo Boss, Under Armour, Tommy Hilfiger, Nike and many more. The investigative team encountered a great deal of second-hand clothing, as well as clothing that was completely new, some even with price tags still attached. \u2018Though these fashion brands are not dumping clothing in the Atacama directly, the industry\u2019s overproduction and its dirty supply chains make them complicit,\u2019 Sum of Us added. A spokesperson for H&M told Metro.co.uk: \u2018We take this matter extremely seriously and immediately started an investigation to make sure that our own strict waste disposal and recycling processes were followed by all our partners. \u2018Based on the outcome of this investigation, we do not hold any connection to this area and to deposit clothing in nature certainly goes against what we and our sustainability efforts stand for. However, the report clearly shows that textile recycling is still an industry-wide challenge, regardless of brand or charity organisation. \u2018There is still no developed infrastructure to collect textiles at end of use. \u2018To truly be able to change the system we need to scale circular business models and textile to textile recycling. \u2018H&M Group works actively to change the system and find scalable solutions that will help us steer this low value re-use towards recycling instead.\u2019 Adidas told Metro.co.uk: \u2018Adidas ensures proper disposal of waste across the company and does not dump products. \u2018To avoid waste we are increasing the use of recycled materials. By 2024, Adidas will only use recycled polyester, already today we are at more than 90%. \u2018Adidas is also working on taking back more and more used products to repurpose materials. \u2018In the US, we launched a comprehensive takeback program in September 2021. Additional markets will follow this year.\u2019 Old Navy, Levi\u2019s, Zara, Hugo Boss, Under Armour, Tommy Hilfiger and Nike have been contacted by Metro.co.uk, but are yet to respond. The clothes are sent in large garbage bales, along with shoes, plastics, wires, wallets, household, cardboard and other rubbish, to the clothing dump. Beyond the dump, residents of the Alto Hospicio region are dealing with porter trucks driving through the area to dump the waste, causing pollution and soil contamination. She added that the dump attracts \u2018vectors\u2019 (disease-carrying insects, like tics) to the local area. \u2018When they burn these clothes, all of this contamination affects the people who live here.\u2019 Closer to the dumping ground, locals are dealing with even worse conditions. According to SumOfUs and Desierto Vestido, around 1,000 of the most impoverished people in Chile live on or near to the actual dumping grounds. \u2018The residents live off the clothes,\u2019 Astudillo said. \u2018But they only separate clothes they plan to resell and throw away or burn the rest.\u2019 One local resident who lives just outside of the dumping ground, who wanted to remain anonymous, told Metro.co.uk: \u2018Those of us who live in these houses are mainly affected by the infection that is created by the accumulation of this waste and the plague of rats it brings. \u2018Every time there is a fire, it takes days to burn out and, for some people, the smoke causes allergic reactions, respiratory difficulties or vomiting. \u2018We cannot go anywhere else \u2013 this is where we live and we are in an extremely precarious situation. \u2018Everyday we are at risk that there will be another fire and that our families will suffer the consequences.\u2019 Laura Krasovitzky, of SumOfUs, said: \u2018While the last few months brought media coverage to how the Atacama Desert has turned into a fast fashion dump, no one talked about the companies involved in this dirty supply chain. \u2018At SumOfUs, we wanted to shine a light on the biggest corporate culprits contributing to this environmental disaster so we sent an investigative team that not only confirmed our suspicions on how some of the world\u2019s most well-known fashion brands were present in the desert, but also unveiled how close the dump site is to local communities.

            "description": "The American Lung Association has released a report detailing the public health benefits of a complete national shift to zero-emission vehicles from 2020 to 2050. Apparently, if all new passenger and heavy-duty vehicles sold by 2035 and 2040, respectively, are zero-emission models, 110,000 deaths could be avoided in the United States over the next 30 years. That figure came from the association's analysis, which also projects that the Biden administration will achieve its target of having 100 percent carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035.With no air pollution affecting people's health, up to 2.79 million asthma attacks could also be avoided. And perhaps to convince companies to get onboard with the transition, the association also made it a point to mention that up to 13.4 million lost workdays could be avoided with cleaner air.\u00a0Harold Wimmer, National President and CEO of the American Lung Association, said in a statement:\"Zero-emission transportation is a win-win for public health. Too many communities across the U.S. deal with high levels of dangerous pollution from nearby highways and trucking corridors, ports, warehouses and other pollution hot spots. Plus, the transportation sector is the nation\u2019s biggest source of carbon pollution that drives climate change and associated public health harms. This is an urgent health issue for millions of people in the U.S.\"The widespread transition to zero-emission vehicles would generate up to $1.2 trillion in public health benefits, the report noted, and $1.7 trillion in climate benefits. Communities and counties with the highest percentage of lower-income families and People of Color in the US would benefit greatly from the shift, since they have areas with highly concentrated doses of pollution from diesel hotspots, power plants and other fossil fuel facilities. The top metro locations that would benefit the most include Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, San Jose, Washington, Miami, Houston, Detroit and Dallas Fort-Worth.\u00a0To be able to ensure that all new vehicles sold by 2040 are zero-emission and that the grid can supply the country with pollution-free electricity within 15 years, the association has listed a series of recommendations. They include a call for increased funding for non-combustion electricity generation and transportation, extending and expanding incentives for zero-emission vehicle purchases and \"converting public fleets to zero-emission vehicles immediately.\" The association is also urging the Congress to pass legislation that would accelerate the transition and for the EPA to adopt standards that would require lower carbon emissions from vehicles before the shift is complete.\u00a0",

            "full_description": "Company aims for 20-percent customer emissions reduction by 2030 JACKSON, Mich. , March 30, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- CMS Energy and its primary business, Consumers Energy, today pledged to protect the planet by achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions from the company's entire natural gas production and delivery system \u2014 including customers and suppliers \u2014 by 2050. Achieving net zero emissions means eliminating the impact of emissions traced to the burning of natural gas by customers and greenhouse gas emissions caused by natural gas suppliers who produce and transport natural gas to Consumers Energy's system. \"Natural gas is safe and affordable and now it can be even more clean,\" President and CEO Garrick Rochow said. \"We're making historic, industry-leading changes to protect our planet. This commitment is another step in leading the clean energy transformation for Michigan .\" As a next step on our path to net zero by 2050, the company will partner with customers to reduce their emissions by 20 percent by 2030. CMS Energy is already implementing industry-leading plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These include: Modernizing its natural gas system to achieve net zero methane emissions from its operations by 2030. Ending coal use and boosting renewable energy fuel sources to achieve net zero carbon emissions from its electric operations by 2040. Pledging to power 1 million electric vehicles in the communities it serves by 2030. Pursuing a net zero goal for all emission sources, including those from customers and suppliers, aligns the company's efforts with Michigan's Healthy Climate Plan to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 as well as the recommendations of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming. CMS Energy is executing and exploring a variety of pathways to support customers and suppliers who want to reduce their emissions. Carbon offsets: The company recently received regulatory approval for a new program for residential and business customers who want to voluntarily offset carbon emissions from their natural gas use by investing in projects that help Michigan forests reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Renewable natural gas, or RNG: Produced from organic wastes and other renewable sources, RNG is interchangeable with conventional natural gas and a key technology available to reduce methane emissions. The company recently announced an agreement with Swisslane Farms in west Michigan to build a biodigester facility that, with regulatory approval, will convert agricultural waste into RNG. Energy efficiency: Providing customers with the power to reduce energy waste and lower bills through a variety of energy efficiency and demand response programs. Since 2009, we've helped customers save about $4 billion and prevented the emission of almost 19 million tons of carbon dioxide. Emerging technologies: Potential solutions include using hydrogen to produce energy, capturing and permanently storing carbon emissions from natural gas combustion and using hybrid natural gas and electric heat pump systems to heat homes and businesses. The company is also modernizing its natural gas operations with a 10-year Natural Gas Delivery Plan to ensure the continued delivery of safe, reliable, affordable and clean natural gas. The plan includes accelerated infrastructure replacement, innovative leak detection and key process changes to eliminate, avoid and minimize methane emissions. CMS Energy (NYSE: CMS ) is a Michigan -based company that has an electric and natural gas utility, Consumers Energy, as its primary business. It also owns and operates independent power generation businesses. Consumers Energy, Michigan's largest energy provider, provides natural gas and/or electricity to 6.8 million of the state's 10 million residents in all 68 Lower Peninsula counties.

            "description": "Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and his energy minister said Saudi Arabia would tackle climate change, but also stressed the continued importance of hydrocarbons and said it would continue to ensure oil market stability. He also said it would double the emissions cuts it plans to achieve by 2030.",
            "full_description": "Saudi Arabia's crown prince said on Saturday that the world's top oil exporter aims to reach \"net zero\" emissions of greenhouse gases, mostly produced by burning fossil fuels, by 2060 - 10 years later than the United States. He also said it would double the emissions cuts it plans to achieve by 2030. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and his energy minister said Saudi Arabia would tackle climate change, but also stressed the continued importance of hydrocarbons and said it would continue to ensure oil market stability. They were speaking at the Saudi Green Initiative (SGI) ahead of COP26, the United Nations climate conference in Glasgow at the end of the month, which hopes to agree deeper global emissions cuts to tackle global warming. The United States, the world's second-biggest emitter, is committed to achieving net zero, meaning that it emits no more greenhouse gases than it can capture or absorb, by 2050. But China and India, the world's biggest and third-biggest emitters, have not committed to this timeline. Saudi Energy Minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and minister of state for the United Arab Emirates, Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber attend the Saudi Green Initiative Forum Amin Nasser, chief executive of the state oil giant Saudi Aramco, said it was counterproductive to \"demonise\" hydrocarbons. He said Aramco aimed to expand its oil and gas production capacity while also achieving net zero emissions from its own operations by 2050. He called for more global investment to ensure adequate crude oil supplies. Prince Mohammed said in recorded remarks that the kingdom aimed to reach net zero by 2060 under its circular carbon economy programme, \"while maintaining its leading role in strengthening security and stability of global oil markets\". He said Saudi Arabia would join a global initiative on slashing emissions of methane by 30% from 2020 levels by 2030, which both the United States and the EU have been pressing. U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres, in a phone call with Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz, welcomed the kingdom's initiatives to reduce emissions, state media said. 'HYDROCARBONS STILL NEEDED' U.S. climate envoy John Kerry is due to attend a wider Middle East green summit in Riyadh on Monday. The SGI aims to eliminate 278 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per year by 2030, up from a previous target of 130 million tonnes. The crown prince said the SGI initiative would involve investments of over 700 billion riyals ($190 billion) in that time period. Saudi Arabia's economy remains heavily reliant on oil, although the crown prince is trying to promote diversification. Saudi Arabia's economy remains heavily reliant on oil, although the crown prince is trying to promote diversification. Energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said the world needed fossil fuels as well as renewables. \"It has to be a comprehensive solution,\" he said. \"We need to be inclusive, and inclusivity requires being open to accept others' efforts as long as they are going to reduce emissions.\" He said the kingdom's younger generation \"will not wait for us to change their future\". He said net zero might be achieved before 2060 but the kingdom needed time to do things \"properly\". Another Gulf oil producer, the United Arab Emirates, this month announced a plan for net zero emissions by 2050. The non-profit Climate Action Tracker consortium gives Saudi Arabia its lowest possible ranking, \"Critically insufficient\". Saudi Arabia's first renewable energy plant opened in April and its first wind farm began generating in August. It does, however, have plans to build a $5 billion plant to produce hydrogen, a clean fuel, and state-linked entities are pivoting to green fundraising. 0 Comments (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Here is what\u2019s on the radar of our editors for the morning of March 30 \u2026 What we are watching in Canada \u2026 The chief of a First Nation searching for unmarked graves at a former residential school in British Columbia says they\u2019re looking for long-term funding as they prepare for a visit today by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Chief Willie Sellars from Williams Lake First Nation says his community, along with others conducting similar investigations at former government-funded, church-run institutions across Canada need financial support for their work from start to finish. He says reconciliation starts with a healthy community, and they also need long-term funding to support the mental health and well-being of residential school survivors, their families, and Indigenous communities. The First Nation in B.C.\u2019s central interior announced in January that a preliminary geophysical investigation had found 93 \u201creflections\u201d that could indicate children buried around the site of the former St. Joseph\u2019s Mission Residential School. He says they need Ottawa to provide complete records about the institution, along with support in urging the Roman Catholic Church to do the same, as they work to identify children who never returned home. Sellars says the federal government\u2019s role in advancing reconciliation should also include support for economic development and key community needs, like housing. The investigation at St. Joseph\u2019s came after ground-penetrating radar located what are believed to be more than 200 graves at a former institution in Kamloops last year. Trudeau told media in Vancouver on Tuesday that he was looking forward to meeting with Sellars to talk about the challenges and hardships his community and others have experienced since the finding of unmarked graves. \u2014 Also this \u2026 A former junior hockey player with life-altering injuries from a bus crash in Saskatchewan is getting a boost he\u2019s been anticipating for two years. Ryan Straschnitzki was paralyzed from the chest down when a bus carrying the Humboldt Broncos was in a crash in 2018, killing 16 and injuring three others. He had an epidural implant in his spine three years ago to help stimulate nerves and move limbs. Since receiving the implant, Straschnitzki has been able to stand on his own and take a few steps with a walker. This week, the 22-year-old is having the stimulator reprogrammed in Calgary to make sure it continues to work efficiently. A planned upgrade was delayed for two years because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Straschnitzki, who hopes to excel at sledge hockey, says has been working to improve his core strength. He says he is hopeful the upgrade will help him continue to make progress, because over time bodies get adapted to certain stimulation. \u2014 What we are watching in the U.S. \u2026 SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Tuesday blocked parole for Charles Manson follower Leslie Van Houten, reversing a panel\u2019s recommendation that she be freed after spending a half-century in prison. Van Houten, 72, \u201ccurrently poses an unreasonable danger to society if released from prison at this time,\u201d Newsom said in his parole review. It was the fifth time that a California governor has rejected her release. Her attorney, Rich Pfeiffer, disputed that view and said the decision will be appealed in court. He accused Newsom of rejecting parole because he is worried about \u201chis political future\u201d and noted that Van Houten has a spotless prison disciplinary record. Van Houten is serving a life sentence for helping Manson and others kill Los Angeles grocer Leno LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary, in August 1969. Van Houten was 19 when she and other cult members fatally stabbed the LaBiancas and smeared the couple\u2019s blood on the walls. The day before, other Manson followers, not including Van Houten, killed pregnant actress Sharon Tate and four others. In his rejection letter, Newsom noted that Van Housen had undergone therapy, earned educational degrees and taken self-help classes in prison and had shown \u201cincreased maturity and rehabilitation.\u201d But Van Houten also has \u201cgaps in insight\u201d that continue to make her a danger to society, Newsom said. Van Houten has had 21 parole hearings since 1982. Most parole boards denied her bid for freedom. But five panels have recommended her release since 2016, saying she had expressed remorse and was no longer a threat to public safety. Newsom rejected a recommendation made last November, and previously reversed parole recommendations in 2019 and 2020. In February, the California Supreme Court refused to hear Van Houten\u2019s appeal of the 2020 rejection. \u2014 What we are watching in the rest of the world \u2026 KYIV, Ukraine _ Russia\u2019s pledge to scale back some military operations in Ukraine drew skepticism even as the two nations planned to return Wednesday to talks that could produce a framework for ending the war that has imposed an increasingly punishing toll. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said there was no reason to believe Russia\u2019s announcement that it would reduce military activity near Kyiv, the capital, as well as in the northern city of Chernihiv, given what\u2019s still happening on the ground. \u201cWe can call those signals that we hear at the negotiations positive,\u201d he said in his nightly video address to the Ukrainian people. \u201cBut those signals don\u2019t silence the explosions of Russian shells.\u201d It was a bitter reality check in a rare moment of optimism five weeks into what has devolved into a bloody war of attrition, with thousands dead and almost 4 million Ukrainians fleeing the country. Earlier Tuesday, Ukraine\u2019s delegation at the conference, held in Istanbul, laid out a framework under which the country would declare itself neutral and its security would be guaranteed by an array of other nations. Moscow\u2019s public reaction was positive, and the negotiations were expected to resume Wednesday in Istanbul. Meanwhile, Germany triggered an early warning level for natural gas supplies and called on consumers to save energy amid concerns that Russia could cut off deliveries unless it is paid in rubles. Western nations have rejected the Russian demand for ruble payments, arguing it would undermine the sanctions imposed against Moscow over the war in Ukraine. \u2014 On this day in 1972 \u2026 Canadian sailors got a daily rum ration for the last time, ending a navy tradition dating back to 1667. \u2014 In entertainment \u2026 NEW YORK _ Foo Fighters have cancelled all upcoming concert dates following the death of the band\u2019s drummer, Taylor Hawkins. The rockers had been scheduled to play at the Grammy Awards in Las Vegas on Sunday as well as spring dates at the Beale Street Music Festival; the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival; Columbia, Maryland; Raleigh, North Carolina; Daytona Beach; Charlotte, North Carolina; the Boston Calling Music Festival; and summer dates in Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, France and the UK. \u201cIt is with great sadness that Foo Fighters confirm the cancellation of all upcoming tour dates in light of the staggering loss of our brother,\u201d the band said in a statement Tuesday. Hawkins died Friday during a South American tour with the rock band. He was 50. \u201cWe\u2019re sorry for and share in the disappointment that we won\u2019t be seeing one another as planned,\u201d the band\u2019s statement read. \u201cInstead, let\u2019s take this time to grieve, to heal, to pull our loved ones close, and to appreciate all the music and memories we\u2019ve made together.\u201d Hawkins was Alanis Morissette\u2019s touring drummer when he joined Foo Fighters in 1997. He played on the band\u2019s biggest albums including \u201cOne by One\u201d and \u201cIn Your Honor,\u201d and on hit singles like \u201cBest of You.\u201d In lead singer David Grohl\u2019s 2021 book \u201cThe Storyteller,\u201d he called Hawkins his \u201cbrother from another mother, my best friend, a man for whom I would take a bullet.\u201d \u2014 Did you see this? OTTAWA _ Canada\u2019s Conservatives continue to reject the target the Liberal government set for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, as the party searches for a new leader who will decide its approach to tackle climate change. On Tuesday, the federal government released its plan for how it hopes to achieve its latest goal, which is to cut carbon-related pollution by 40 to 45 per cent from 2005 levels by the end of the decade. Tory environment critic Kyle Seeback says the party doesn\u2019t support that plan. Instead, it favours the target the Conservative government set back in 2015 under the leadership of former prime minister Stephen Harper. When he came into office later that year, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signed onto the plan, committing under the Paris agreement to reduce the country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. Last year Trudeau increased those targets ahead of international climate talks in the fall, saying Canada now aims for 40 to 45 per cent below 2005 levels. \u201cIt\u2019s great to intend things and to hope for things,\u201d Seeback said on Tuesday. \u201cWhat we need (are) actual plans that result in emission reductions and what we get from this government are plans that cost a lot of money.\u201d He pointed out that the Liberals have failed to achieve past climate goals and dismissed the plan presented Tuesday as lacking in details about the impact the reductions would have on resource-based industries and taxpayers. \u201cI\u2019m all for aspirational things, but at the end of the day, what we need are plans that actually work and don\u2019t have incredibly catastrophic effects on the Canadian economy.\u201d \u2014 This report by The Canadian Press was first published March 30, 2022.

He accused Newsom of rejecting parole because he is worried about \u201chis political future\u201d and noted that Van Houten has a spotless prison disciplinary record. Van Houten is serving a life sentence for helping Manson and others kill Los Angeles grocer Leno LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary, in August 1969. Van Houten was 19 when she and other cult members fatally stabbed the LaBiancas and smeared the couple\u2019s blood on the walls. The day before, other Manson followers, not including Van Houten, killed pregnant actress Sharon Tate and four others. In his rejection letter, Newsom noted that Van Housen had undergone therapy, earned educational degrees and taken self-help classes in prison and had shown \u201cincreased maturity and rehabilitation.\u201d But Van Houten also has \u201cgaps in insight\u201d that continue to make her a danger to society, Newsom said. Van Houten has had 21 parole hearings since 1982. Most parole boards denied her bid for freedom. But five panels have recommended her release since 2016, saying she had expressed remorse and was no longer a threat to public safety. Newsom rejected a recommendation made last November, and previously reversed parole recommendations in 2019 and 2020. In February, the California Supreme Court refused to hear Van Houten\u2019s appeal of the 2020 rejection. \u2014 What we are watching in the rest of the world \u2026 KYIV, Ukraine _ Russia\u2019s pledge to scale back some military operations in Ukraine drew skepticism even as the two nations planned to return Wednesday to talks that could produce a framework for ending the war that has imposed an increasingly punishing toll. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said there was no reason to believe Russia\u2019s announcement that it would reduce military activity near Kyiv, the capital, as well as in the northern city of Chernihiv, given what\u2019s still happening on the ground. \u201cWe can call those signals that we hear at the negotiations positive,\u201d he said in his nightly video address to the Ukrainian people. \u201cBut those signals don\u2019t silence the explosions of Russian shells.\u201d It was a bitter reality check in a rare moment of optimism five weeks into what has devolved into a bloody war of attrition, with thousands dead and almost 4 million Ukrainians fleeing the country. Earlier Tuesday, Ukraine\u2019s delegation at the conference, held in Istanbul, laid out a framework under which the country would declare itself neutral and its security would be guaranteed by an array of other nations. Moscow\u2019s public reaction was positive, and the negotiations were expected to resume Wednesday in Istanbul. Meanwhile, Germany triggered an early warning level for natural gas supplies and called on consumers to save energy amid concerns that Russia could cut off deliveries unless it is paid in rubles. Western nations have rejected the Russian demand for ruble payments, arguing it would undermine the sanctions imposed against Moscow over the war in Ukraine. \u2014 On this day in 1972 \u2026 Canadian sailors got a daily rum ration for the last time, ending a navy tradition dating back to 1667. \u2014 In entertainment \u2026 NEW YORK _ Foo Fighters have cancelled all upcoming concert dates following the death of the band\u2019s drummer, Taylor Hawkins.

OTTAWA _ Canada\u2019s Conservatives continue to reject the target the Liberal government set for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, as the party searches for a new leader who will decide its approach to tackle climate change. On Tuesday, the federal government released its plan for how it hopes to achieve its latest goal, which is to cut carbon-related pollution by 40 to 45 per cent from 2005 levels by the end of the decade. Tory environment critic Kyle Seeback says the party doesn\u2019t support that plan. Instead, it favours the target the Conservative government set back in 2015 under the leadership of former prime minister Stephen Harper. When he came into office later that year, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signed onto the plan, committing under the Paris agreement to reduce the country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. Last year Trudeau increased those targets ahead of international climate talks in the fall, saying Canada now aims for 40 to 45 per cent below 2005 levels. \u201cIt\u2019s great to intend things and to hope for things,\u201d Seeback said on Tuesday. \u201cWhat we need (are) actual plans that result in emission reductions and what we get from this government are plans that cost a lot of money.\u201d He pointed out that the Liberals have failed to achieve past climate goals and dismissed the plan presented Tuesday as lacking in details about the impact the reductions would have on resource-based industries and taxpayers. \u201cI\u2019m all for aspirational things, but at the end of the day, what we need are plans that actually work and don\u2019t have incredibly catastrophic effects on the Canadian economy.\u201d \u2014 This report by The Canadian Press was first published March 30, 2022.

Here is what\u2019s on the radar of our editors for the morning of March 30 \u2026 What we are watching in Canada \u2026 The chief of a First Nation searching for unmarked graves at a former residential school in British Columbia says they\u2019re looking for long-term funding as they prepare for a visit today by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Chief Willie Sellars from Williams Lake First Nation says his community, along with others conducting similar investigations at former government-funded, church-run institutions across Canada need financial support for their work from start to finish. He says reconciliation starts with a healthy community, and they also need long-term funding to support the mental health and well-being of residential school survivors, their families, and Indigenous communities. The First Nation in B.C.\u2019s central interior announced in January that a preliminary geophysical investigation had found 93 \u201creflections\u201d that could indicate children buried around the site of the former St. Joseph\u2019s Mission Residential School. He says they need Ottawa to provide complete records about the institution, along with support in urging the Roman Catholic Church to do the same, as they work to identify children who never returned home. Sellars says the federal government\u2019s role in advancing reconciliation should also include support for economic development and key community needs, like housing. The investigation at St. Joseph\u2019s came after ground-penetrating radar located what are believed to be more than 200 graves at a former institution in Kamloops last year. Trudeau told media in Vancouver on Tuesday that he was looking forward to meeting with Sellars to talk about the challenges and hardships his community and others have experienced since the finding of unmarked graves. \u2014 Also this \u2026 A former junior hockey player with life-altering injuries from a bus crash in Saskatchewan is getting a boost he\u2019s been anticipating for two years. Ryan Straschnitzki was paralyzed from the chest down when a bus carrying the Humboldt Broncos was in a crash in 2018, killing 16 and injuring three others. He had an epidural implant in his spine three years ago to help stimulate nerves and move limbs. Since receiving the implant, Straschnitzki has been able to stand on his own and take a few steps with a walker. This week, the 22-year-old is having the stimulator reprogrammed in Calgary to make sure it continues to work efficiently. A planned upgrade was delayed for two years because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Straschnitzki, who hopes to excel at sledge hockey, says has been working to improve his core strength. He says he is hopeful the upgrade will help him continue to make progress, because over time bodies get adapted to certain stimulation. \u2014 What we are watching in the U.S. \u2026 SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ California Gov.

            "full_description": "Addressing unnamed politicians who would say that the current moment \u2014 with the war in Ukraine stoking inflation and driving up gas prices \u2014 is a bad time for fighting climate change, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told his audience in Vancouver on Tuesday that \"this is no time for excuses.\" \"The question is not whether we keep going on climate action,\" Trudeau argued. \"The question is how much more we can do, and how quickly.\" The climate plan Trudeau's government released on Tuesday is one proposal for how much and how fast Canada should move. His government will continue to face questions about whether it is moving as quickly as it could. But the new report also shows exactly how much bolder Canada's governments and industries must be if this country is to do its part to ensure a livable future for the planet \u2014 and exactly where the boldest action is necessary. Canada releases plan for a 40 per cent cut in carbon emissions by 2030 Q&A Canada's plan to reduce carbon emissions is 'a little weak,' says youth climate activist Saskatchewan's plan to build small nuclear reactors draws mixed reactions The new official plan for meeting Canada's greenhouse gas emissions reductions target for 2030 is the first mandatory report to Parliament under new climate accountability legislation . The 271-page document , a detailed account of what has been done and must be done to meet Canada's emissions targets, was quickly hailed as a \" watershed moment \" for Canadian climate policy. In time, these regular progress reports may come to rival the annual budget as the most important document released by the federal government. But the most useful aspect of this first report is how it lays out the possible emissions trajectories for each of Canada's major sources of greenhouse gases. This is the first time the federal government has looked forward to 2030 in such detail. In his remarks Tuesday, Trudeau chose to focus on the oil and gas and transportation sectors \u2014 for good reasons. While overall emissions in Canada have been relatively stable over the last 17 years, the national trend has obscured significant differences between sectors. Students take part in a climate change protest in Montreal on Friday, Sept. 24, 2021. (Ryan Remiorz/The Canadian Press) \"Since 2005, emissions in the oil and gas and transportation sectors have increased by 20 per cent and 16 per cent, respectively,\" the report notes. \"Decreases in electricity (48 per cent), heavy industry (12 per cent) and waste and others (10 per cent) have offset these increases.\" The oil and gas and transportation sectors are also the two largest sources of emissions in Canada. The challenge is most acute \u2013 and most politically fraught \u2013 in oil and gas. As the government acknowledges in its own report, \"the oil and gas sector contributes significantly to the Canadian economy\" and \"the challenge of meeting Canada's climate objectives and transforming an industry as complex as oil and gas to net-zero emissions is huge.\" In its projections, the government suggests the oil and gas industry could reduce its annual emissions from 191 megatonnes in 2019 to 110 Mt in 2030 \u2014 a 31 per cent reduction from 2005 levels. Shell's Quest Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) facility in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta on October 7, 2021. (Todd Korol/Reuters) The government identifies several policy levers that could help the industry get there \u2014 a new investment tax credit for carbon capture and storage, a declining cap on the sector's emissions and a focus on reducing methane leaks. It also promises support for workers who might be affected by disruptions in the sector. Trudeau \u2014 a prime minister the Conservatives have enthusiastically labelled \"anti-oil\" \u2014 framed these projections in decidedly pro-industry terms. \"If there's any oil and gas sector in the world that can do it, it's Canada,\" he said. \"And if there's any workforce in the world that can drive this shift, it's Canadians.\" Alberta Premier Jason Kenney \u2014 who has been agitating for the federal government to freeze the national carbon tax and posting memes about green energy policies \u2014 might not be so optimistic. Even Alberta NDP leader Rachel Notley dismissed the federal projections as \"fantasy.\" WATCH: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau unveils emissions report Canada's new emissions reduction plan calls for a 40 per cent cut by 2030 16 hours ago Duration 1:31 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announces Canada's Emissions Reduction Plan to keep the country on track to net-zero by 2050. 1:31 The federal Conservatives warned that expecting such reductions from the oil and gas sector would have a \"devastating effect.\" The government, Conservatives said, should instead focus on getting Canada's \"ethical energy\" to the world \u2014 though how energy products could be described as \"ethical\" if they can't be reconciled with Canada's climate targets is a riddle. Industry executives might be more willing to play along, with the caveat that such reductions will require a great deal of \" cooperation \" \u2014 significant amounts of public funding, in other words. The tax credit for carbon capture and storage is likely to appear in next month's federal budget, though it might not be as generous as oil executives were hoping. The industry would like the credit to cover 75 per cent of new investment costs. The government might offer to cover 50 per cent. But Trudeau also seems ready to argue the industry is capable of helping itself. \"With record profits, this is the moment for the oil and gas sector to invest in the sustainable future that will be good for business, good for communities, and good for our future,\" he said on Tuesday. Industry leaders might also note that some critics think the sector got off easy in Tuesday's plan. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau argues that, thanks to soaring profits, the oil and gas industry has the means to do more to fight climate change. (Robert Short/CBC) In advance of the report's release, the Pembina Institute argued the industry should be able to reach 88 Mt by 2030 \u2014 a 45 per cent reduction in line with Canada's overall goal. Caroline Brouillette, the executive director of the Climate Action Network, said in a statement on Tuesday that \"some sectors \u2014 most notably oil and gas \u2014 will not contribute their fair share.\" Some emissions are harder to reduce than others and not every economic sector or province is going to move at the same pace. Matters of \"fairness\" and feasibility will always be up for debate. But the abiding lesson of climate policy is that avoiding reality doesn't make anything easier. Lower emissions for oil and gas in 2030 might be easier to envision now, for instance, had action been taken sooner after 2005. One might gaze wistfully at the climate plan that Stephen Harper's government tabled in 2008 , with its promise that tough new requirements would be imposed on the oilsands. There may be some risk in trying to act too fast. But the simple math of climate change is even harder to avoid now. And if Canadian leaders don't move as boldly as possible in the short term, it might be just that much harder to reduce emissions later.",

            "content": "Some of China's state-affiliated reporters have posited themselves as trendy Instagram influencers or bloggers.Peter Dazeley / Getty Images China's influence on US social media platforms is growing, an AP examination has found. Dozens of Chinese state-media reporters are posing online as travel influencers while actively parroting the state's stance. Chinese influencer social-media accounts are often inconsistently labeled as state-funded media. WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 To her 1.4 million followers across TikTok, YouTube, Instagram and Facebook, Vica Li says she is a \"life blogger\" and \"food lover\" who wants to teach her fans about China so they can travel the country with ease.\"Through my lens, I will take you around China, take you into Vica's life!\" she says in a video posted in January to her YouTube and Facebook accounts, where she also teaches Chinese classes over Zoom.But that lens may be controlled by CGTN, the Chinese-state run TV network where she has regularly appeared in broadcasts and is listed as a digital reporter on the company's website. And while Vica Li tells her followers that she \"created all of these channels on her own,\" her Facebook account shows that at least nine people manage her page.That portfolio of accounts is just one tentacle of China's rapidly growing influence on U.S.-owned social media platforms, an Associated Press examination has found.Trendy bloggers or government mouthpieces?As China continues to assert its economic might, it is using the global social media ecosystem to expand its already formidable influence. The country has quietly built a network of social media personalities who parrot the government's perspective in posts seen by hundreds of thousands of people, operating in virtual lockstep as they promote China's virtues, deflect international criticism of its human rights abuses and advance Beijing's talking points on world affairs like Russia's war against Ukraine.Some of China's state-affiliated reporters have posited themselves as trendy Instagram influencers or bloggers. The country has also hired firms to recruit influencers to deliver carefully crafted messages that boost its image to social media users.And it is benefitting from a cadre of Westerners who have devoted YouTube channels and Twitter feeds to echoing pro-China narratives on everything from to Olympian Eileen Gu, in the most recent Winter Games.The influencer network allows Beijing to easily proffer propaganda to unsuspecting Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and YouTube users around the globe. At least 200 influencers with connections to the Chinese government or its state media are operating in 38 different languages, according to from Miburo, a firm that tracks foreign disinformation operations.\"You can see how they're trying to infiltrate every one of these countries,\" said Miburo President Clint Watts, a former FBI agent. \"It is just about volume, ultimately. If you just bombard an audience for long enough with the same narratives people will tend to believe them over time.\"'Travelers' promoting China as an idyllic destinationWhile as a brazen assault on democracy, self-described \"traveler,\" \"story-teller\" and \"journalist\" Li Jingjing took to YouTube to offer a different narrative.She posted a video to her account called \"Ukraine crisis: The West ignores wars & destructions it brings to Middle East,\" in which she mocked U.S. journalists covering the war. She's also dedicated other videos to amplifying about the conflict, including claims of Ukrainian genocide or that the U.S. and NATO provoked Russia's invasion.Li Jingjing says in her YouTube profile that she is eager to show her roughly 21,000 subscribers \"the world through my lens.\" But what she does not say in her segments on Ukraine, which have tens of thousands of views, is that she is a reporter for CGTN, articulating views that are not just her own but also familiar Chinese government talking points.Most of China's influencers use pitches similar to Li Jingjing's in hopes of attracting audiences around the world, including the U.S., Egypt and Kenya. The personalities, many of them women, call themselves \"travelers,\" sharing photos and videos that promote China as an idyllic destination.\"They clearly have identified the 'Chinese lady influencer' is the way to go,\" Watts said of China.More than 10 million followers and subscribersThe AP identified dozens of these accounts, which collectively have amassed more than 10 million followers and subscribers. Many of the profiles belong to Chinese state media reporters who have in recent months transformed their Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube accounts \u2014 platforms that are largely blocked in China \u2014 and begun identifying as \"bloggers,\" \"influencers\" or non-descript \"journalists.\" Nearly all of them were running Facebook ads, targeted to users outside of China, that encourage people to follow their pages.The personalities do not proactively disclose their ties to China's government and have largely phased out references in their posts to their employers, which include CGTN, China Radio International and Xinhua News Agency.Foreign governments have long tried to exploit social media, as well as its ad system, to influence users. During the 2016 U.S. election, for example,\u00a0a Russian internet agency paid in rubles to run more than 3,000 divisive political ads targeting Americans.In response, tech companies like Facebook and Twitter promised to better alert American users to foreign propaganda by labeling state-backed media accounts.But the AP found in its review that most of the Chinese influencer social media accounts are inconsistently labeled as state-funded media. The accounts \u2014 like those belonging to Li Jingjing and Vica Li \u2014 are often labeled on Facebook or Instagram, but are not flagged on YouTube or TikTok. Vica Li's account is not labeled on Twitter. Last month, Twitter began identifying Li Jingjing's account as Chinese state-media.Vica Li said in a YouTube video that she is disputing the labels on her Facebook and Instagram accounts. She did not respond to a detailed list of questions from the AP.Hidden intentionsOften, followers who are lured in by accounts featuring scenic images of China's landscape might not be aware that they'll also encounter state-endorsed propaganda.Jessica Zang's picturesque Instagram photos show her smiling beneath a beaming sun, kicking fresh powered snow atop a ski resort on the Altai Mountains in China's Xinjiang region during the Beijing Olympics. She describes herself as a video creator and blogger who hopes to present her followers with \"beautiful pics and videos about life in China.\"Zang, a video blogger for CGTN, rarely mentions her employer to her 1.3 million followers on Facebook. Facebook and Instagram identify her account as \"state-controlled media\" but she is not labeled as such on TikTok, YouTube or on Twitter, where Zang lists herself as a \"social media influencer.\"\"I think it's likely by choice that she doesn't put any state affiliations, because you put that label on your account, people start asking certain types of questions,\" Rui Zhong, who researches technology and the China-U.S. relationship for the Washington-based Wilson Center, said of Zang.Peppered between tourism photos are posts with more obvious propaganda. One video titled \"What foreigners in BEIJING think of the CPC and their life in China?\" features Zang interviewing foreigners in China who gush about the Chinese Communist Party and insist they're not surveilled by the government the way outsiders might think.\"We really want to let more people ... know what China is really like,\" Zang tells viewers.That's an important goal in China, which has to shape its image abroad and whose president, Xi Jinping, has spoken openly of his desire to have China perceived favorably on the global stage.Ultimately, accounts like Zang's are intended to obscure global criticisms of China, said Jessica Brandt, a Brookings Institution expert on foreign interference and disinformation.\"They want to promote a positive vision of China to drown out their human rights records,\" Brandt said.Li Jingjing and Zang did not return messages from the AP seeking comment. CGTN did not respond to repeated interview requests. CGTN America, which is registered as a foreign agent with the Justice Department and has disclosed having commercial arrangements with several international news organizations, including the AP, CNN and Reuters, did not return messages. A lawyer who has represented CGTN America did not respond either.A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, Liu Pengyu, said in a statement, \"Chinese media and journalists carry out normal activities independently, and should not be assumed to be led or interfered by the Chinese government.\"A $300,000 payment to recruit influencersChina's interest in the influencer realm became more evident in December after it was revealed that the Chinese Consulate in New York had paid $300,000 for New Jersey firm Vippi Media to recruit influencers to post messages to Instagram and TikTok followers during the Beijing Olympics, including content that would highlight China's work on climate change.It's unclear what the public saw from that campaign, and if the social media posts were properly labeled as paid advertisements by the Chinese Consulate, as Instagram and TikTok require. Vippi Media has not provided the Justice Department, which regulates foreign influence campaigns through a 1938 statute known as the Foreign Agents Registration Act, a copy of the posts it paid influencers to disseminate, even though federal law requires the company to do so.Vipp Jaswal, Vippi Media's CEO, declined to share details about the posts with the AP.In other cases, the money and motives behind these Facebook posts, YouTube videos and podcasts are so murky that even those who create them say they weren't aware the Chinese government was financing the project.Chicago radio host John St. Augustine told the AP that a friend who owns New World Radio in Falls Church, Virginia, invited him to host a podcast called \"The Bridge\" with a team in Beijing. The hosts discussed daily life and music in the U.S. and China, inviting music industry workers as guests.He says he didn't know CGTN had paid New World Radio $389,000 to produce the podcast. The station was also paid millions of dollars to broadcast CGTN content 12 hours daily, according to documents filed with the Justice Department on behalf of the radio company.\"How they did all that, I had no clue,\" St. Augustine said. \"I was paid by a company here in the United States.\"The station's relationship with CGTN ended in December, said New World Radio co-owner Patricia Lane.The Justice Department recently requested public input on how it should update the FARA statute to account for the ephemeral world of social media and its transparency challenges.\"It's not leaflets and hard copy newspapers anymore,\" FARA unit chief Jennifer Kennedy Gellie said of messaging. It's \"tweets and Facebook posts and Instagram images.\"A growing chorus of English-speaking influencers has also cultivated an online niche by promoting pro-Chinese messaging in YouTube videos or tweets.Last April, as CGTN sought to expand its network of influencers, it invited English speakers to join a months-long competition that would end with jobs working as social media influencers in London, Nairobi, Kenya or Washington. Thousands applied, CGTN said in September, describing the event as a \"window for young people around the world to understand China.\"British video blogger Jason Lightfoot raved about the opportunity in a video on YouTube advertising the event.\"So many crazy experiences that I'll never forget for the rest of my life, and that's all thanks to CGTN,\" Lightfoot said in a video he said was filmed from China tech company Huawei's campus.Lightfoot, who did not respond to requests for comment, does not disclose this relationship with CGTN on his YouTube profile, where he has accrued millions of views with headlines like \"The Olympics Backfired on USA \u2014 Disastrous Regret\" and \"Western Media Lies about China.\"The video topics are often in sync with those of other pro-China bloggers like Cyrus Janssen, a U.S. citizen living in Canada. During the Olympics, Janssen and Lightfoot both shared videos celebrating Gu's three-medal win, using identical images of the Olympian in posts that blasted the U.S.\"USA's boycott failure ... Eileen Gu Wins Gold!\" Lightfoot posted on Feb. 10. That same day, Janssen uploaded a video titled \"Is Eileen Gu a Traitor to America? American Expat Shares the Truth.\"In emails to the AP, Janssen said his videos are intended to educate people about China and said he's never accepted money from the Chinese government. But when pressed for details about some of his partnerships, which include Chinese tech firms, Janssen responded only with questions about an AP's reporter salary. The AP also found videos that show him appearing on CGTN broadcasts.The Western influencers routinely decry what they see as distorted American media coverage of Beijing and life there. Some posts, for instance, have ridiculed Western concerns over the safety of Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai, after leveling sexual assault allegations against a former high-ranking member of China's ruling Communist Party. She resurfaced around the Olympics in a controlled interview in which she vigorously denied wrongdoing by Chinese officials and said her initial allegations had created an \"enormous misunderstanding.\"Her abrupt about-face prompted skeptical reactions in the West, which YouTuber Andy Boreham mocked in a video in which he invoked language reminiscent of the MeToo movement. \"I wonder what happened to #BelieveAllWomen,\" he said.Boreham is a New Zealander and columnist for Shanghai Daily. Twitter recently labeled his account as Chinese-state affiliated media. His YouTube account remains unlabeled. In a statement, YouTube said it only applies state-affiliated media labels to organizations, not individuals who work for or with state-funded media.In a YouTube post last year, Lightfoot, who has more than 200,000 subscribers, marveled at video footage of what he said were \"clean, modern, peaceful, pleasant\" streets of China. The post then cut to video of gritty, trash-strewn streets he said were in Philadelphia.\"When I first saw this video,\" he says by way of narration, \"I actually thought it was from a movie. I thought it was from a zombie movie or some kind of end-of-the-world movie. But it's not. This is real. This is America.\"YouTubers Matthew Tye, an American, and Winston Sterzel, who is from South Africa, believe that, in many cases, China's paying for videos to be created.Their evidence?The pair was included last year on an email pitch to numerous YouTube influencers from a company that identified itself as Hong Kong Pear Technology. The email asked the influencers to share a promotional video for China's Hainan province, a tourist beach destination, on their channels.Tye and Sterzel, who spent years living in China and became vocal critics of its government, assume they were probably included on the pitch by mistake.But, intrigued, they engaged in a back-and-forth with the company while feigning interest in the offer. The company representative soon followed up with a new request \u2014 that they post a propaganda video that claimed COVID-19 did not originate in China, where the first case was detected, but rather from North American white-tailed deer.\"We could offer $2000 (totally negotiable considering the nature of this type of content) lemme know if u are interested,\" an employee named Joey wrote, according to emails shared with the AP.After Tye and Sterzel asked for articles that would back up the false claim, the emails stopped.In an email to the AP, a Pear Technology employee confirmed he had contacted Tye and Sterzel, but said he did not know much about the client, adding \"it might be from the government??\"Tye and Sterzel say the exchange pulls back the curtain on how China pushes propaganda through influencers who profit from it.\"There's a very easy formula to become successful,\" Sterzel said in an interview. \"It's simply to praise the Chinese government, to praise China and talk about how great China is and how bad the West is.\"___Catalini reported from Trenton, New Jersey.Read the original article on Insider",

Some posts, for instance, have ridiculed Western concerns over the safety of Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai, after leveling sexual assault allegations against a former high-ranking member of China's ruling Communist Party. She resurfaced around the Olympics in a controlled interview in which she vigorously denied wrongdoing by Chinese officials and said her initial allegations had created an \"enormous misunderstanding.\" Her abrupt about-face prompted skeptical reactions in the West, which YouTuber Andy Boreham mocked in a video in which he invoked language reminiscent of the MeToo movement. \"I wonder what happened to #BelieveAllWomen,\" he said. Boreham is a New Zealander and columnist for Shanghai Daily. Twitter recently labeled his account as Chinese-state affiliated media. His YouTube account remains unlabeled. In a statement, YouTube said it only applies state-affiliated media labels to organizations, not individuals who work for or with state-funded media. In a YouTube post last year, Lightfoot, who has more than 200,000 subscribers, marveled at video footage of what he said were \"clean, modern, peaceful, pleasant\" streets of China. The post then cut to video of gritty, trash-strewn streets he said were in Philadelphia. \"When I first saw this video,\" he says by way of narration, \"I actually thought it was from a movie. I thought it was from a zombie movie or some kind of end-of-the-world movie. But it's not. This is real. This is America.\" YouTubers Matthew Tye, an American, and Winston Sterzel, who is from South Africa, believe that, in many cases, China's paying for videos to be created. Their evidence? The pair was included last year on an email pitch to numerous YouTube influencers from a company that identified itself as Hong Kong Pear Technology. The email asked the influencers to share a promotional video for China's Hainan province, a tourist beach destination, on their channels. Tye and Sterzel, who spent years living in China and became vocal critics of its government, assume they were probably included on the pitch by mistake. But, intrigued, they engaged in a back-and-forth with the company while feigning interest in the offer. The company representative soon followed up with a new request \u2014 that they post a propaganda video that claimed COVID-19 did not originate in China, where the first case was detected, but rather from North American white-tailed deer. \"We could offer $2000 (totally negotiable considering the nature of this type of content) lemme know if u are interested,\" an employee named Joey wrote, according to emails shared with the AP. After Tye and Sterzel asked for articles that would back up the false claim, the emails stopped. In an email to the AP, a Pear Technology employee confirmed he had contacted Tye and Sterzel, but said he did not know much about the client, adding \"it might be from the government??\" Tye and Sterzel say the exchange pulls back the curtain on how China pushes propaganda through influencers who profit from it. \"There's a very easy formula to become successful,\" Sterzel said in an interview. \"It's simply to praise the Chinese government, to praise China and talk about how great China is and how bad the West is.\" ___ Catalini reported from Trenton, New Jersey.",

Even a normal pair of headphones would make sense because Dyson is in the business of moving air, and sound is basically just air moving in specific ways. If you guessed that last one, you would be kind of right. It\u2019s a pair of noise cancelling headphones with a large battery that powers a personal air purifying visor that looks like it leapt off the screen from a Mad Max/Power Rangers crossover.

Not talking about it has caused near physical pain. I have been writing about technology for roughly 15 years and this is the craziest device I have ever seen a major company launch. I can\u2019t believe this exists and is a real thing. It\u2019s amazing. People will buy and wear these in public. Hell, I will probably buy and wear one of these in public.

They charge using a USB-C port on the left ear cup. They\u2019ve got 11 microphones, nine for noise cancellation and two for phone calls. You can wear the headphones without the visor, but you need the headphones to use the visor. The filter is replaceable and will need to be switched out roughly every 12 months. It is not designed to be worn by children. I\u2019m torn because I love air purifiers and headphones. I collect headphones and they\u2019re the gadget that first made me fall in love with gadgets. And, since I have the asthma and allergies of one of those inbred English royals, I am extremely interested in air purifiers and have always wanted a portable one.

I just never imagined the two devices being combined this early and it\u2019s making the apocalypse seem awfully nigh.

The Dyson Zone wasn\u2019t designed for the pandemic, and has in fact been in the works for the last six years. Fun fact: the original design was apparently a kind of backpack and snorkel combination, and it took 500 prototypes to get to this version. Less Hannibal-like when photographed this way. Image: Dyson window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_1_hpu-mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); Wearing a mask during the COVID-19 pandemic and flu season more broadly is to protect other people from you potentially carrying and spreading the virus without knowing, while this purifier only protects you from other people. Put simply, the air that goes into your face has been purified, the air that comes out of your face is someone else\u2019s problem. The good news, though, is that there is a P2 mask attachment that clips into the purifying visor so you can have fresh, purified air pumped into your protective mask. It\u2019s a game changer for people in very high-risk groups (like people with cancer, autoimmune diseases, or anaemia), but also makes this device seem even more dystopian. Potentially lifesaving, but still one of those moments where you need to stop and ask how we came to this point as a species. Meet Frank. Image: Dyson The Dyson Zone was created and tested on a mannequin named Frank, who kind of looks like the love child of Aang from Avatar: The Last Air Bender and Vision from the MCU (by which I mean he\u2019s bald and has a strip of sensors on his face). Frank has a set of mechanical lungs and can mimic the human breathing profile. To see how The Dyson Zone reacted to a variety of real-world situations, they put Frank in a wind tunnel and then blasted polluted air at him. According to the briefing, the Zone did a good job of protecting Frank from most of the pollution, so that\u2019s a good sign. The Dyson Zone\u2019s purpose is to help people with the problem of air pollution and noise pollution, which plague roughly 90 per cent of the world\u2019s population. This is a really important problem to solve because, according to the WHO, 4.2 million people die as a result of poor outdoor air quality each year, which is horrifying.

However, if that\u2019s not an option, an expensive headset using plastic and rare Earth materials, so rich people can still breathe, making fresh air a luxury item, is a solid plan B. Jokes about our impending, climate change-related deaths aside, if you can get past the appearance, a device like this really does stand a chance of helping vulnerable people who can afford it.

The Dyson Zone seems like a great product, as someone who relies on noise cancelling headphones in crowds, and also relies heavily on air purifiers at home (I\u2019ve seen the difference they made to my family\u2019s asthma), I really want one of these. I just wish their existence didn\u2019t feel like the next step towards the apocalypse due to widespread inaction on climate change.

The drop in pollution from tailpipes and power plants would prevent up to 110,000 premature deaths by 2050, the report projects. It would also avoid 2.78 million asthma attacks and 13.4 million lost workdays. All in all, that would amount to $1.2 trillion in public health benefits. That\u2019s assuming all new passenger cars sold in the US are EVs by 2035 and all new heavy-duty vehicles sold are electric by 2040. What\u2019s more, those vehicles would need to be powered by a fossil fuel-free grid. But replacing the vast majority of the nation\u2019s roughly 280 million cars and trucks on the road with electric vehicles in such a short timeframe remains virtually impossible. Just under 3 percent of new vehicles purchased in the US in 2021 are electric, despite their growing popularity. \u201cI can\u2019t ensure that they have clean, healthy air to breathe \u2014 and that is incredibly frustrating to me\u201d Regardless, the health advocates say a safe environment should be non-negotiable. \u201cI can advise [my patients] to limit their time spent outside to limit the pollution they are breathing; I can\u2019t ensure that they have clean, healthy air to breathe \u2014 and that is incredibly frustrating to me,\u201d Afif El-Hasan, a pediatrician and American Lung Association volunteer, said on a press call. \u201cIt should be a right of every child to play and develop somewhere safe. That should not be up for debate ever.\u201d More than four in 10 Americans live in a place with unhealthy levels of air pollution, according to the American Lung Association. Breathing in that pollution has been tied to cancer, heart attacks, strokes, and lung diseases. It can lead to impaired lung development in children, which can then affect them throughout their lives. Americans of color are also disproportionately burdened by air pollution, according to the American Lung Association; they\u2019re three times more likely to be breathing the worst air pollution compared to white Americans. For its new report, the American Lung Association looked at how phasing out fossil fuel combustion from the transportation and power sectors would limit key pollutants. That includes soot, smog-forming nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds, and sulfur dioxide coming from tailpipes and smokestacks. The report authors also studied another type of pollution that often flies under the radar and which electric vehicles are still responsible for: non-exhaust emissions. That includes particles that enter the air from the wear-and-tear of roads and vehicles, say from tires or brake pads. The persistence of this type of pollution shows why better public transportation and more walkable cities \u2014 to reduce reliance on driving \u2014 are also important for a healthier future. The report also points out health benefits from cutting down greenhouse gas emissions that drive climate change. A warming climate affects air quality by speeding up the chemical reaction that produces smog and exacerbating pollution from wildfires. E-bikes, scooters, and other light electric vehicles can also significantly cut down greenhouse gas pollution when they replace cars, according to a recent industry-commissioned report produced by the German Aerospace Center. In the US, President Joe Biden has set a goal of getting half of all new cars sold in the US by 2030 to be electric or hybrid vehicles. Earlier this month, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed new regulation specifically aimed at slashing pollution from trucks. The Biden administration\u2019s climate goals also include achieving a clean power sector by 2035. Phasing out fossil fuels from the power grid is essential for cleaning up transportation, the American Lung Association report highlights.

            "content": "SAO PAULO: Ultra-processed foods are having a negative impact on the diversity of plant species available for human consumption while also damaging human and planetary health, according to a commentary published in the journal BMJ Global Health.Ultra-processed foods such as sweetened or salty snacks, soft drinks, instant noodles, reconstituted meat products, pre-prepared pizza and pasta dishes, biscuits and confectionery, are made by assembling food substances, mostly commodity ingredients, and 'cosmetic' additives (notably flavours, colours and emulsifiers) through a series of industrial processes. Nutrition experts from Brazil, the US and Australia have investigated the issue and warned that these products are the basis of a 'globalised diet' and are becoming dominant in the global food supply, with sales and consumption growing in all regions and almost all countries, particularly in the upper-middle-income and lower-middle income countries. According to the experts, the global agrobiodiversity - the variety and variability of animals, plants and microorganisms used directly or indirectly for food and agriculture \u2014 is declining, especially the genetic diversity of plants used for human consumption. Peoples' diets are becoming less diverse, with ultra-processed foods replacing the variety of wholefoods necessary for a balanced and healthy diet.

            "full_description": "SAO PAULO: Ultra-processed foods are having a negative impact on the diversity of plant species available for human consumption while also damaging human and planetary health, according to a commentary published in the journal BMJ Global Health. Ultra-processed foods such as sweetened or salty snacks, soft drinks , instant noodles, reconstituted meat products, pre-prepared pizza and pasta dishes, biscuits and confectionery, are made by assembling food substances, mostly commodity ingredients, and 'cosmetic' additives (notably flavours, colours and emulsifiers) through a series of industrial processes. Nutrition experts from Brazil, the US and Australia have investigated the issue and warned that these products are the basis of a 'globalised diet' and are becoming dominant in the global food supply, with sales and consumption growing in all regions and almost all countries, particularly in the upper-middle-income and lower-middle income countries. According to the experts, the global agrobiodiversity - the variety and variability of animals, plants and microorganisms used directly or indirectly for food and agriculture \u2014 is declining, especially the genetic diversity of plants used for human consumption. Peoples' diets are becoming less diverse, with ultra-processed foods replacing the variety of wholefoods necessary for a balanced and healthy diet. As much as 90 per cent of humanity's energy intake comes from just 15 crop plants, and more than four billion people rely on just three of them - rice, wheat and maize. Production of ultra-processed foods involved greater use of ingredients extracted from a handful of high-yielding plant species (such as maize, wheat, soy and oil seed crops) which meant that animal-sourced ingredients used in many ultra-processed foods were often derived from confined animals fed on the same crops.

            "full_description": "OTTAWA \u2014 Canada\u2019s Conservatives continue to reject the target the Liberal government set for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, as the party searches for a new leader who will decide its approach to tackle climate change. On Tuesday, the federal government released its plan for how it hopes to achieve its latest goal, which is to cut carbon-related pollution by 40 to 45 per cent from 2005 levels by the end of the decade. Tory environment critic Kyle Seeback says the party doesn\u2019t support that plan. Instead, it favours the target the Conservative government set back in 2015 under the leadership of former prime minister Stephen Harper. When he came into office later that year, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signed onto the plan, committing under the Paris agreement to reduce the country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. Last year Trudeau increased those targets ahead of international climate talks in the fall, saying Canada now aims for 40 to 45 per cent below 2005 levels. \u201cIt\u2019s great to intend things and to hope for things,\u201d Seeback said on Tuesday. \u201cWhat we need (are) actual plans that result in emission reductions and what we get from this government are plans that cost a lot of money.\u201d He pointed out that the Liberals have failed to achieve past climate goals and dismissed the plan presented Tuesday as lacking in details about the impact the reductions would have on resource-based industries and taxpayers. \u201cI\u2019m all for aspirational things, but at the end of the day, what we need are plans that actually work and don\u2019t have incredibly catastrophic effects on the Canadian economy.\u201d Conservative leadership contenders will need to address their ideas for the country\u2019s approach to climate change as they compete for the party\u2019s top job. The new leader is set to be announced Sept. 10. Much of the party\u2019s support comes from Western Canada, home to oil-producing provinces that want to ensure the sector\u2019s survival. At the same time, the Tories have also had to deal with criticism that they didn\u2019t present a plan to properly tackle climate change during the 2019 federal election campaign. Candidates have kicked off the first weeks of the current race by championing a rallying cry from 2019 that remains popular with the grassroots: a promise to scrap the carbon price. That\u2019s something many members are excited to hear after former leader Erin O\u2019Toole promised a carbon price of his own in an effort to course-correct during the most recent election. Ottawa-area MP Pierre Poilievre has been beating that drum and plans to hold a rally in the nation\u2019s capital Friday against the scheduled rise in the federal charge, which is set to take effect that day. Poilievre didn\u2019t directly answer when asked whether he supports the current government\u2019s 2030 targets, but in a statement Tuesday said Trudeau would \u201cdrive up energy prices at home and oil production abroad.\u201d He is campaigning on a promise to build more pipelines and end Canada\u2019s foreign oil imports. When it comes to combating climate change, he vows to reduce emissions through \u201ctechnology and not taxes.\u201d \u201cThese technologies include carbon capture, emissions-free nuclear power and helping other countries shut down their coal-fired power plants by exporting them cleaner natural gas, nuclear power and hydroelectricity,\u201d Poilievre said in a statement. In another statement, Michelle Coates Mather, a spokeswoman for Jean Charest \u2014 the former Quebec premier who introduced a cap-and-trade system for that province \u2014 said he would release his plan for the environment in the \u201cweeks ahead.\u201d \u201cMr. Charest agrees with lowering emissions,\u201d she wrote, adding he\u2019s the only candidate \u201cwho has a track record on emissions and cutting pollution.\u201d Since he entered the race, Charest has expressed support for carbon pricing, but has so far declined to say when he endorses one for consumer goods, like fuel. On Tuesday, Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown also sidestepped a question about his support for Canada\u2019s 2030 targets. He tweeted that Ottawa should forgo its planned increase to the federal carbon price and pledged to make sure the Conservative party has a climate plan that protects the energy sector and taxpayers. Scott Aitchison, a rural Ontario MP who\u2019s running for leader, said in a statement that he supports \u201cCanada\u2019s original Paris commitments\u201d and believes in the need to shore up the country\u2019s infrastructure against the effects of climate change to mitigate costs.",

            "content": "New year, new budget. The federal government has outlined how it wants to spend the country\u2019s money over the next year, with some interesting funding and cuts across the board in the 2022 budget. Take note, seeing as we\u2019re due to have a federal election in the next couple of months, the budget is more of a set of promises right now. Should the coalition be re-elected then this is what we can expect from the federal budget. Main takeaways from the 2022 federal budget 1. Cost of living one-off payments The federal budget outlined a couple of one-off cost of living payments for low and middle-income earning Australians. Six million Australians who are currently on government payments (including Youth Allowance and Jobseeker) are set to nab a one-off $250 payment in April. The amount is tax-free but if you\u2019re receiving support from more than one government scheme, you\u2019ll still only get one payment. This will be the last year of the low and middle-income tax offset that the government introduced in 2019, but the payment is being increased by an additional $420 for its final year. This means you earn a get an extra $420 on top of whatever you were set to receive from the offset when you file your 2022 tax return. Those who pay tax but earn under $126,001 per year are eligible for the scheme. 2. Fuel excise The Russia/Ukraine conflict has seen fuel prices skyrocket worldwide, including here in Australia. window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_1_mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); To try and subsidise this the government has cut the fuel excise in half for the next six months, meaning motorists will save 22.1 cents per litre. On September 28, the fuel excise will revert to 44.2 cents per litre. 3. Health In anticipation of COVID-19 continuing to plague us in 2022-2023, the federal budget has allocated $4.2 billion to the pandemic response. $1 billion of that will be dedicated to further vaccine rollout and $2.6 billion towards supplies like protective equipment and RATs. Women\u2019s health also got a boost with $58 million going towards the treatment of endometriosis. Tests for conditions like cystic fibrosis, spinal muscular atrophy and fragile X syndrome will be free under Medicare from late 2023. Mental health was also something that got a specific call out in the federal budget. The National Mental Health and Suicide Prevention plan is getting $547 million of additional funding which will support regional initiatives, enhanced services through Headspace and Lifeline and improved access to affordable support and training. Those on a mental health plan will also receive extra partially-subsidised visits to a psychologist through Medicare. 4. Parental leave window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_1_hpu-mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); The government\u2019s paid parental leave scheme is shifting with this budget. At the moment, mothers can access 18 weeks of parental leave, but fathers or other primary carers are only covered for two weeks. By March 1 next year, these schemes will be combined, allowing parents to access 20 weeks of paid parental leave and split it between them however they want. Single parents will also have access to this same scheme. The government also plans to broaden eligibility by giving any household that earns under $350,000 access to paid parental leave. 5. First Home Buyers The government\u2019s Home Guarantee scheme is expanding to 50,000 spots a year for the next three years. This allows people to enter the market with just 5% of a home deposit, with the government guaranteeing a portion of up to 15%. 35,000 places will be dedicated to first home buyers and 10,000 spots will go to regional homebuyers who are either buying their first home or re-entering the property market. 6. Other winners from the 2022 budget There were some interesting and much-needed funding additions included in the Federal Budget for 2022. Here are some of the winners. Australia\u2019s cyber defence capabilities are being boosted with a $9.9 billion package aiming to increase our country\u2019s cyber preparedness with more jobs for computer programmers and software engineers. window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_2_mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); $1 billion is going towards the protection of the Great Barrier Reef, with funds allocated to improving water quality and boosting research and reef management. Disaster relief is also a priority in the budget with the government expecting to spend $6 billion on the 2022 NSW and QLD floors, with at least $3 billion going towards income and housing support services, repairs for businesses and farmers and community clean up and recovery. A new $2.8 billion incentive scheme for apprentices is being introduced. Under this scheme, the government will provide wage subsidies (up to $4,500 in the first year) to businesses taking on trainees in priority fields. What is considered a priority field is yet to be announced. Apprentices will also be able to access $5,000 in funds for training support that will be split across two years. 7. Who missed out in the 2022 Federal budget? It happens with every federal budget, but there were some losers this year. Renewables have been neglected for yet another year. Instead, the government is funnelling money towards low-emissions technologies like hydrogen. Climate change was also a term that was largely ignored in the budget papers. The arts, which has already been hit particularly hard by the pandemic, was not given any further support in the 2022 budget. In fact, spending on the arts is set to be cut under the new budget by almost $200 million in 2022-23. Again, a reminder that this is an election year so all of the above will depend on the outcome of the polls in May. If you\u2019re interested in perusing the very long, federal budget in full you can see the papers here, or read Frydenberg\u2019s speech here.

            "content": "Anthony Kwan/Getty ImagesSince its debut in 2009, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have seen explosive growth and some dramatic downturns. Cryptocurrencies now inhabit an increasingly prominent niche in the global financial landscape, offering \u201cpastime\u201d opportunities for young investors, channelling donations to Ukraine\u2019s war effort or simply providing cheaper and faster alternatives to mainstream banking. In Aotearoa New Zealand, the Reserve Bank recently decided to investigate crypto as part of a wider conversation about how New Zealanders will pay and save in the future. So far, crypto has benefited from light regulation in New Zealand, but it\u2019s essential we have a clear picture of all pros and cons, including the risk of criminal behaviour and climate change impacts. Cryptocurrencies offer a variety of investment and transaction benefits, but concerns about dangers are also growing. Crypto\u2019s volatile track record presents significant risk to investors (alongside significant reward) and the relative anonymity of Bitcoin, Ethereum and others is proving attractive to organised crime, money laundering and tax evasion. Read more: Crypto theft is on the rise. Here's how the crimes are committed, and how you can protect yourself To date, crypto has largely avoided the traditional forms of financial regulation banks face and it has capitalised on its ability to eschew territorial borders, being everywhere and nowhere at once. As calls for effective regulation get louder and major markets in the US, EU and Asia seek to subject crypto to greater oversight, it is particularly important to highlight crypto\u2019s growing but often hidden environmental impact. Bitcoin uses more energy than most countries How do companies with only virtual assets contribute to environmental damage? The answer is data mining. Cryptocurrencies and assets use blockchain technology. In essence, transactions are verified and recorded on a blockchain, a public digital ledger that contains information about all transactions. Blockchain technology ensures the integrity of crypto transactions, but it does so by using huge amounts of electricity. Bitcoin\u2019s annual electricity consumption is more than three times that of New Zealand. This is due to blockchain\u2019s distributed nature and use of cryptography and complex processing, which require considerable computational power.

Earlier this year, Kazakhstan cut off crypto miners because of the country\u2019s energy crisis. When the electricity used by crypto comes from fossil fuels, the connection to climate change becomes clearer. Recent developments in the US are setting a worrying trend. Crypto\u2019s colossal energy needs may be met by electricity from coal-fired power stations, at a time when the energy sector should pivot towards renewables. In Kentucky, a new crypto \u201cblockchain farm\u201d is being built close to four coal-fired power plants, for easy energy supply. Meanwhile, another coal-fired power station in Montana has been brought back from the brink of closure after agreeing to act as the sole electricity supplier to a Bitcoin mining company, Marathon, adding hundreds of thousands of tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Cryptocurrencies and climate change The need to act decisively on climate change has never been more urgent. Last year, New Zealand announced its new Nationally Determined Contribution to cut emissions by 50% on 2005 levels by 2030 as part of collective efforts to limit global temperature rise to 1.5\u2103 above pre-industrial levels. This is an improvement on the previous pledge, but Climate Action Tracker still rates New Zealand\u2019s overall contribution to climate change mitigation as \u201chighly insufficient\u201d. The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), released last month, details the impacts of overshooting the 1.5\u2103 target. For Australasia, these include increased heat-related deaths and disease for people and wildlife, loss of livelihoods and a drop in income from agriculture and loss of low-lying coastal areas as a result of rising sea levels. Insufficient action on climate change now will have serious consequences, including close to home. According to a recent survey, most New Zealanders accept the need to take action to combat climate change. But all too often people\u2019s lifestyle decisions still seem disconnected from their environmental impacts. Confusion remains around what people can meaningfully do to make positive change.

That's why some are afraid of it \u2013 and some welcome it Regarding crypto, to make informed and responsible choices, New Zealanders need a clear picture of how our consumer and investment decisions affect the planet.

While it backed off the proposal, cryptocurrencies will likely face further scrutiny as the EU tries to tackle the climate crisis.

Cryptocurrencies now inhabit an increasingly prominent niche in the global financial landscape, offering \u201c pastime \u201d opportunities for young investors, channelling donations to Ukraine\u2019s war effort or simply providing cheaper and faster alternatives to mainstream banking. In Aotearoa New Zealand, the Reserve Bank recently decided to investigate crypto as part of a wider conversation about how New Zealanders will pay and save in the future. So far, crypto has benefited from light regulation in New Zealand, but it\u2019s essential we have a clear picture of all pros and cons, including the risk of criminal behaviour and climate change impacts. Cryptocurrencies offer a variety of investment and transaction benefits, but concerns about dangers are also growing. Crypto\u2019s volatile track record presents significant risk to investors (alongside significant reward) and the relative anonymity of Bitcoin, Ethereum and others is proving attractive to organised crime, money laundering and tax evasion. Read more: Crypto theft is on the rise. Here's how the crimes are committed, and how you can protect yourself To date, crypto has largely avoided the traditional forms of financial regulation banks face and it has capitalised on its ability to eschew territorial borders, being everywhere and nowhere at once. As calls for effective regulation get louder and major markets in the US, EU and Asia seek to subject crypto to greater oversight , it is particularly important to highlight crypto\u2019s growing but often hidden environmental impact. How do companies with only virtual assets contribute to environmental damage? The answer is data mining. Cryptocurrencies and assets use blockchain technology. In essence, transactions are verified and recorded on a blockchain, a public digital ledger that contains information about all transactions.

            "content": "OTTAWA \u2014 Canada\u2019s Conservatives continue to reject the target the Liberal government set for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, as the party searches for a new leader who will decide its approach to tackle climate change. On Tuesday, the federal government released its plan for how it hopes to achieve its latest goal, which is to cut carbon-related pollution by 40 to 45 per cent from 2005 levels by the end of the decade. Tory environment critic Kyle Seeback says the party doesn\u2019t support that plan. Instead, it favours the target the Conservative government set back in 2015 under the leadership of former prime minister Stephen Harper. When he came into office later that year, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signed onto the plan, committing under the Paris agreement to reduce the country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. Last year Trudeau increased those targets ahead of international climate talks in the fall, saying Canada now aims for 40 to 45 per cent below 2005 levels. \u201cIt\u2019s great to intend things and to hope for things,\u201d Seeback said on Tuesday. \u201cWhat we need (are) actual plans that result in emission reductions and what we get from this government are plans that cost a lot of money.\u201d He pointed out that the Liberals have failed to achieve past climate goals and dismissed the plan presented Tuesday as lacking in details about the impact the reductions would have on resource-based industries and taxpayers. \u201cI\u2019m all for aspirational things, but at the end of the day, what we need are plans that actually work and don\u2019t have incredibly catastrophic effects on the Canadian economy.\u201d Conservative leadership contenders will need to address their ideas for the country\u2019s approach to climate change as they compete for the party\u2019s top job. The new leader is set to be announced Sept. 10. Much of the party\u2019s support comes from Western Canada, home to oil-producing provinces that want to ensure the sector\u2019s survival. At the same time, the Tories have also had to deal with criticism that they didn\u2019t present a plan to properly tackle climate change during the 2019 federal election campaign. Candidates have kicked off the first weeks of the current race by championing a rallying cry from 2019 that remains popular with the grassroots: a promise to scrap the carbon price. That\u2019s something many members are excited to hear after former leader Erin O\u2019Toole promised a carbon price of his own in an effort to course-correct during the most recent election. Ottawa-area MP Pierre Poilievre has been beating that drum and plans to hold a rally in the nation\u2019s capital Friday against the scheduled rise in the federal charge, which is set to take effect that day. Poilievre didn\u2019t directly answer when asked whether he supports the current government\u2019s 2030 targets, but in a statement Tuesday said Trudeau would \u201cdrive up energy prices at home and oil production abroad.\u201d He is campaigning on a promise to build more pipelines and end Canada\u2019s foreign oil imports. When it comes to combating climate change, he vows to reduce emissions through \u201ctechnology and not taxes.\u201d \u201cThese technologies include carbon capture, emissions-free nuclear power and helping other countries shut down their coal-fired power plants by exporting them cleaner natural gas, nuclear power and hydroelectricity,\u201d Poilievre said in a statement. In another statement, Michelle Coates Mather, a spokeswoman for Jean Charest \u2014 the former Quebec premier who introduced a cap-and-trade system for that province \u2014 said he would release his plan for the environment in the \u201cweeks ahead.\u201d \u201cMr. Charest agrees with lowering emissions,\u201d she wrote, adding he\u2019s the only candidate \u201cwho has a track record on emissions and cutting pollution.\u201d Since he entered the race, Charest has expressed support for carbon pricing, but has so far declined to say when he endorses one for consumer goods, like fuel. On Tuesday, Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown also sidestepped a question about his support for Canada\u2019s 2030 targets. He tweeted that Ottawa should forgo its planned increase to the federal carbon price and pledged to make sure the Conservative party has a climate plan that protects the energy sector and taxpayers. Scott Aitchison, a rural Ontario MP who\u2019s running for leader, said in a statement that he supports \u201cCanada\u2019s original Paris commitments\u201d and believes in the need to shore up the country\u2019s infrastructure against the effects of climate change to mitigate costs.

            "full_description": "OTTAWA \u2014 Canada's Conservatives continue to reject the target the Liberal government set for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, as the party searches for a new leader who will decide its approach to tackle climate change. On Tuesday, the federal government released its plan for how it hopes to achieve its latest goal, which is to cut carbon-related pollution by 40 to 45 per cent from 2005 levels by the end of the decade. Tory environment critic Kyle Seeback says the party doesn't support that plan. Instead, it favours the target the Conservative government set back in 2015 under the leadership of former prime minister Stephen Harper. When he came into office later that year, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signed onto the plan, committing under the Paris agreement to reduce the country's greenhouse gas emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. Last year Trudeau increased those targets ahead of international climate talks in the fall, saying Canada now aims for 40 to 45 per cent below 2005 levels. \"It's great to intend things and to hope for things,\" Seeback said on Tuesday. \"What we need (are) actual plans that result in emission reductions and what we get from this government are plans that cost a lot of money.\" He pointed out that the Liberals have failed to achieve past climate goals and dismissed the plan presented Tuesday as lacking in details about the impact the reductions would have on resource-based industries and taxpayers. \"I'm all for aspirational things, but at the end of the day, what we need are plans that actually work and don't have incredibly catastrophic effects on the Canadian economy.\" Conservative leadership contenders will need to address their ideas for the country's approach to climate change as they compete for the party's top job. The new leader is set to be announced Sept. 10. Much of the party's support comes from Western Canada, home to oil-producing provinces that want to ensure the sector's survival. At the same time, the Tories have also had to deal with criticism that they didn't present a plan to properly tackle climate change during the 2019 federal election campaign. Candidates have kicked off the first weeks of the current race by championing a rallying cry from 2019 that remains popular with the grassroots: a promise to scrap the carbon price. That's something many members are excited to hear after former leader Erin O'Toole promised a carbon price of his own in an effort to course-correct during the most recent election. Ottawa-area MP Pierre Poilievre has been beating that drum and plans to hold a rally in the nation's capital Friday against the scheduled rise in the federal charge, which is set to take effect that day. Poilievre didn't directly answer when asked whether he supports the current government's 2030 targets, but in a statement Tuesday said Trudeau would \"drive up energy prices at home and oil production abroad.\" He is campaigning on a promise to build more pipelines and end Canada's foreign oil imports. When it comes to combating climate change, he vows to reduce emissions through \"technology and not taxes.\" \"These technologies include carbon capture, emissions-free nuclear power and helping other countries shut down their coal-fired power plants by exporting them cleaner natural gas, nuclear power and hydroelectricity,\" Poilievre said in a statement. In another statement, Michelle Coates Mather, a spokeswoman for Jean Charest \u2014 the former Quebec premier who introduced a cap-and-trade system for that province \u2014 said he would release his plan for the environment in the \"weeks ahead.\" \"Mr. Charest agrees with lowering emissions,\" she wrote, adding he's the only candidate \"who has a track record on emissions and cutting pollution.\" Since he entered the race, Charest has expressed support for carbon pricing, but has so far declined to say when he endorses one for consumer goods, like fuel. On Tuesday, Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown also sidestepped a question about his support for Canada's 2030 targets. He tweeted that Ottawa should forgo its planned increase to the federal carbon price and pledged to make sure the Conservative party has a climate plan that protects the energy sector and taxpayers. Scott Aitchison, a rural Ontario MP who's running for leader, said in a statement that he supports \"Canada's original Paris commitments\" and believes in the need to shore up the country's infrastructure against the effects of climate change to mitigate costs.

In another statement, Michelle Coates Mather, a spokeswomen for Jean Charest \u2014 the former Quebec premier who introduced a cap-and-trade system for that province \u2014 said he would release his plan for the environment in the \"weeks ahead.\" \"Mr. Charest agrees with lowering emissions,\" she wrote, adding he's the only candidate \"who has a track record on emissions and cutting pollution.\" Since he entered the race, Charest has expressed support for carbon pricing, but has so far declined to say when he endorses one for consumer goods, like fuel. On Tuesday, Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown also sidestepped a question about his support for Canada's 2030 targets. He tweeted that Ottawa should forgo its planned increase to the federal carbon price and pledged to make sure the Conservative party has a climate plan that protects the energy sector and taxpayers. Scott Aitchison, a rural Ontario MP who's running for leader, said in a statement that he supports \"Canada's original Paris commitments\" and believes in the need to shore up the country's infrastructure against the effects of climate change to mitigate costs.

            "full_description": "OTTAWA \u2014 Canada's Conservatives continue to reject the target the Liberal government set for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, as the party searches for a new leader who will decide its approach to tackle climate change. On Tuesday, the federal government released its plan for how it hopes to achieve its latest goal, which is to cut carbon-related pollution by 40 to 45 per cent from 2005 levels by the end of the decade. Tory environment critic Kyle Seeback says the party doesn't support that plan. Instead, it favours the target the Conservative government set back in 2015 under the leadership of former prime minister Stephen Harper. When he came into office later that year, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signed onto the plan, committing under the Paris agreement to reduce the country's greenhouse gas emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. Last year Trudeau increased those targets ahead of international climate talks in the fall, saying Canada now aims for 40 to 45 per cent below 2005 levels. \"It's great to intend things and to hope for things,\" Seeback said on Tuesday. \"What we need (are) actual plans that result in emission reductions and what we get from this government are plans that cost a lot of money.\" He pointed out that the Liberals have failed to achieve past climate goals and dismissed the plan presented Tuesday as lacking in details about the impact the reductions would have on resource-based industries and taxpayers. \"I'm all for aspirational things, but at the end of the day, what we need are plans that actually work and don't have incredibly catastrophic effects on the Canadian economy.\" Conservative leadership contenders will need to address their ideas for the country's approach to climate change as they compete for the party's top job. The new leader is set to be announced Sept. 10. Much of the party's support comes from Western Canada, home to oil-producing provinces that want to ensure the sector's survival. At the same time, the Tories have also had to deal with criticism that they didn't present a plan to properly tackle climate change during the 2019 federal election campaign. Candidates have kicked off the first weeks of the current race by championing a rallying cry from 2019 that remains popular with the grassroots: a promise to scrap the carbon price. That's something many members are excited to hear after former leader Erin O'Toole promised a carbon price of his own in an effort to course correct during the most recent election. Ottawa-area MP Pierre Poilievre has been beating that drum and plans to hold a rally in the nation's capital Friday against the scheduled rise in the federal charge, which is set to take effect that day. Poilievre didn't directly answer when asked whether he supports the current government's 2030 targets, but in a statement Tuesday said Trudeau would \"drive up energy prices at home and oil production abroad.\" He is campaigning on a promise to build more pipelines and end Canada's foreign oil imports.

            "full_description": "Federal Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault on Tuesday unveiled a $9.1-billion climate change plan he says will achieve Canada\u2019s 2030 greenhouse gas emission reduction target, despite the fact it shows the Trudeau Liberals failed to meet their 2020 target. Canada\u2019s emissions in 2020 \u2014 the first year of the pandemic \u2014 haven\u2019t been formally announced yet, but a table in the 2030 plan says Canada\u2019s emissions in 2020 were 674 million tonnes. In 2016, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his government\u2019s target for 2020 \u2014 which used to be Stephen Harper\u2019s target \u2014 was to reduce Canada\u2019s emissions to 17% below 2005 levels by 2020. In the following years, Trudeau and his then-environment minister, Catherine McKenna, repeatedly assured Canadians the Liberals were on track to achieve that target. Canada\u2019s emissions in 2005 were 739 million tonnes, which means Trudeau\u2019s 2020 target was 613 million tonnes. That means the Trudeau government, according to its own numbers released on Tuesday, missed its 2020 target by 61 million tonnes \u2014 equivalent to the total emissions of Canada\u2019s electricity sector for all of 2019. This marks the ninth consecutive time in the past 34 years a Liberal or Conservative government has failed to meet an emission reduction target, going back to the Brian Mulroney government in 1988 and progressing through the Jean Chretien, Paul Martin, Harper, and Trudeau governments. No Canadian government has ever come close to hitting a single emissions reduction target it has set for itself. Guilbeault\u2019s new plan says the measures the Trudeau government is now taking will reduce Canada\u2019s emissions by 36.4% compared to 2005 levels by 2030, meaning that with eight years to go, it is poised to achieve Trudeau\u2019s 2030 target of reducing emissions to at least 40% below 2005 levels by 2030. But based on the performance of Canadian governments going back to 1988, believing any government, Liberal or Conservative, is ever going to hit a climate target it sets for itself is the equivalent of believing that this time, Lucy isn\u2019t going to pull out the football from under Charlie Brown. Given that the best indicator of future performance is past practice, Canadian governments now have a perfect record of failing to meet nine different emission reduction targets going back to 1988. In addition, it\u2019s getting harder and harder to follow the logic behind the numbers in these projections. In the latest plan, for example, the Trudeau government predicts Canada\u2019s emissions are going to be the same in 2021 as they were in 2020. That makes no sense because while Canada\u2019s emissions for 2021 won\u2019t be reported until 2023, 2020 emissions were significantly reduced because of the global recession caused by the first year of the pandemic. In 2021, emissions dramatically rose all over the world as economies began to recover from the pandemic and there\u2019s no reason to think the same thing didn\u2019t happen in Canada. Beyond that, the government keeps changing emission levels retroactively. In 2021, for example, it suddenly raised Canada\u2019s emissions for the base year of 2005 to 739 million tonnes from the 730 million tonnes it reported in 2020, retroactively improving the government\u2019s alleged performance on reducing emissions by 9 million tonnes. The latest report from the federal Environment Ministry is also now including projected future emission cuts from land use and forestry practices, which it hasn\u2019t done in the past, which isn\u2019t part of its climate modelling, and which comes from a different government ministry \u2014 natural resources.",

            "full_description": "Tackling the current energy crisis in the short term and combating the climate emergency in the long term both require rapidly phasing out fossil fuels, a global group that promotes renewable energy said Tuesday. \"The energy transition is far from being on track and anything short of radical action in the coming years will diminish, even eliminate, chances to meet our climate goals.\" The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) launched its new report\u2014 World Energy Transitions Outlook 2022 \u2014at the Berlin Energy Transition Dialogue as Russia's war on Ukraine and climate scientists' mounting warnings have heightened attention on the various negatives impacts of fossil fuels. Echoing the outlook, Francesco La Camera, IRENA's director-general, said in a statement that \"the energy transition is far from being on track and anything short of radical action in the coming years will diminish, even eliminate, chances to meet our climate goals.\" \"Today, governments are facing multiple challenges of energy security, economic recovery, and the affordability of energy bills for households and businesses,\" La Camera noted. \"Many answers lie in the accelerated transition.\" \"But it's a political choice to put policies in place that comply with [the] Paris agreement and the Sustainable Development Agenda,\" he added. \"Investing in new fossil fuel infrastructure will only lock in uneconomic practices, perpetuate existing risks, and increase the threats of climate change.\" While parties to the Paris agreement met in Scotland last year to discuss how to meet its goals of keeping global temperature rise this century below 2\u00b0C and ultimately limiting it to 1.5\u00b0C, experts continue to conclude the world is on track to blow past those targets. \"Progress across all energy uses has been woefully inadequate\" and \"commitments made at COP26 showed a promising trend but still fell short of what is required,\" La Camera wrote in the report's foreword, referencing the 2021 summit in Scotland. According to the Associated Press , La Camera told the conference in Berlin that \"not only the 1.5\u00b0C, the 2\u00b0C goal is really in danger if we don't act and don't make a dramatic change in the way we produce and consume energy.\" Related Content As Climate Summit Ends, Activists Say 'Hollowed-Out' Deal Leaves 1.5\u00b0C Goal 'On Life Support' Jessica Corbett The outlook features a 1.5\u00b0C pathway that \"positions electrification and efficiency as key drivers of the energy transition, enabled by renewables, hydrogen, and sustainable biomass.\" As the report details, the international community could cut off nearly 37 gigatonnes of annual planet-heating emissions by 2050 through: Significant increases in generation and direct uses of renewables-based electricity; Substantial improvements in energy efficiency; The electrification of end-use sectors (e.g. electric vehicles and heat pumps); Clean hydrogen and its derivatives; Bioenergy coupled with carbon capture and storage; and Last-mile use of carbon capture and storage. While some experts and campaigners remain highly critical of carbon capture and storage schemes pushed by polluters, the outlook's overarching demand for a rapid transition to clean energy aligns with calls from scientists and climate advocacy groups. \"It is high time to act,\" La Camera declared. \"Recent developments have clearly demonstrated that high fossil fuel prices can result in energy poverty and loss of industrial competitiveness.\" Related Content 340+ Groups Tell Governments Worldwide to Prioritize Fossil Fuel Phaseout Kenny Stancil The agency leader also highlighted that \"80% of the global population lives in countries that are net-importers of fossil fuels. By contrast, renewables are available in all countries, offering a way out of import dependency and allowing countries to decouple economies from the costs of fossil fuels while driving economic growth and new jobs.\" Specifically, the outlook projects that \"by 2030, the 1.5\u00b0C-aligned energy transition promises the creation of close to 85 million additional energy transition-related jobs compared to 2019 and support a boost in global gross domestic product (GDP).\" \"The additional 26.5 million jobs in renewables and 58.3 million extra jobs in energy efficiency, power grids and flexibility, and hydrogen more than offset losses of 12 million jobs in the fossil fuel and nuclear industries,\" the report points out. Getting there by the end of this decade will require investing $5.7 trillion per year, according to IRENA, which also calls for redirecting $700 billion in annual investments in fossil fuels toward transition technologies to avoid stranded assets\u2014or, as the AP put it, \"avoid creating wells, pipelines, and power plants that can't be used anymore.\" As the AP noted: This demand was echoed by U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who called for an end to private sector financing for coal power, which surged to record highs last year. \"Lenders need to recognize that coal and fossil fuels are futile investments that will lead to billions of dollars in stranded assets,\" he said. With countries such as the United States ramping up domestic fossil fuel production amid energy price hikes and fears of supply shortages because of Russia's war in Ukraine, Guterres urged governments not to delay the shift away from fossil fuels. \"The current crisis shows that we must accelerate, not slow, the renewable energy transition,\" he said. \"This is the only true path to energy security.\" Guterres has been especially critical of rich nations most responsible for polluting the planet. Last month, he called the findings of the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report an \"atlas of human suffering and a damning indictment of failed climate leadership.\" \"The facts are undeniable. This abdication of leadership is criminal,\" he said at the time, as the panel detailed how human-caused global heating is already impacting nature and billions of lives globally. \"The world's biggest polluters are guilty of arson of our only home.\"",

What the document presented by Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault says is that if Canada wants to come close to achieving Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s pledge to reduce Canada\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% below 2005 levels by 2030 \u2014 the following things have to happen. Within eight years, current emission levels must contract by 77% in the electricity sector; 43% in the \u201cwaste and others\u201d sector, which includes coal production, light manufacturing, construction and forest resources; 42% in the oil and gas sector; 42% in the buildings sector; 32% in the heavy industry sector and 23% in the transportation sector. The only major sector of the economy that comes out unscathed is the agriculture sector at a 0.3% reduction, which is not to say the price of food won\u2019t be going up along with everything else under this plan. The idea all of this can be achieved by 2030, relying largely on not ready for prime time renewable forms of energy such as wind, solar and biomass, is absurd. Even using reliable, conventional forms of energy \u2014 such as non-emitting hydro and nuclear power and low-emitting natural gas \u2014 the latter two of which Guilbeault ideologically opposes going back to his days as a Greenpeace activist \u2014 this plan would cause massive disruption to the Canadian economy. Finally, even if it were to magically happen, the plan predicts Canada\u2019s emissions will fall by 36.4% compared to 2005 levels, short of Trudeau\u2019s minimum goal of a 40% cut and maximum goal of a 45% reduction by 2030. Then again, for the Liberals, what\u2019s in their plan isn\u2019t all that important. What\u2019s important to them is they have a plan \u2014 even if it\u2019s a word salad laced with magical thinking and promises of new technologies that haven\u2019t been invented yet \u2014 so that they can say the federal Conservatives don\u2019t have one. The challenge for the next Conservative leader will be to explain to Canadians why this plan doesn\u2019t make sense.",

            "content": "OTTAWA \u2014 Canada has had at least 11 different climate plans and nine emissions targets since 1988. Here\u2019s a snapshot of some of them. 1988: Canada hosts a conference in Toronto called Changing Atmosphere: Implications for Global Security, where governments and NGOs agree that human behaviour is affecting the atmosphere. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney gives the opening address, and by the end of the event, parties agree to strive to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 20 per cent below 1988 levels by 2005. 1990: The Mulroney government releases the Green Plan, which includes $175 million for about two dozen new policies on greenhouse gas emissions, including investments in energy efficiency, alternative energy and tree planting. It sets a goal to \u201cstabilize\u201d emissions at 1990 levels by 2000. 1992: Canada signs the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Rio de Janeiro, which sets up the next three decades of global conferences to address greenhouse gas emissions. 1993: In the federal election, Liberal Leader Jean Chr\u00e9tien promises to cut emissions to 80 per cent of what they were in 1988 by 2005, the same target Mulroney agreed to in 1988. 1995: Chretien\u2019s government introduces the National Action Program on Climate Change, promising to cut 66 million tonnes of emissions from current levels in 15 years. The plan includes more than 400 possible projects or programs, such as retrofitting federal buildings, updating the national building code to identify thermal efficiencies and convincing industry to voluntarily submit climate plans. 1997: Canada agrees to the Kyoto Protocol, an extension of the UN climate framework. It sets a new target to cut emissions to six per cent below 1990 levels by 2012. 1998: The federal government introduces its new Action Plan 2000 on Climate Change to work toward its Kyoto target, with a $500-million investment over five years. It includes goals to improve vehicle fuel efficiency, investments in renewable energy and a promise to look further at using carbon capture and storage technology in the oil and gas sector. 2002: Climate Change Plan for Canada, another pathway toward the Kyoto target, talks about emissions credits trading, increased use of ethanol and biodiesel, investments in public transit and aiming to retrofit one-fifth of commercial and institutional buildings by 2010. 2005: Project Green: A Plan for Honouring our Kyoto Commitment followed the 2005 federal budget, which included more than $3 billion in climate investments, including funds to encourage wind power and other renewable energy options and tax incentives for efficient energy generation. The latest plan encourages the development of a domestic emissions credit trading system, and promises to regulate emissions from certain industries. 2007: Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper, a year after saying Canada wouldn\u2019t be able to meet the Kyoto target, sets a new goal to cut emissions to 20 per cent below 2006 levels by 2020. It\u2019s the first to base its action mostly on cutting emissions intensity \u2014 the amount of greenhouse gas produced per unit of production, such as per barrel of oil, or tonne of steel. 2009: Canada signs the Copenhagen Accord, a new global climate plan under which Canada promises to cut emissions 17 per cent below 2005 levels by 2020. 2011: Canada formally withdraws from the Kyoto Protocol. 2015: Environment Minister Leona Aglukkaq submits a new national emissions target ahead of a major UN climate conference in Paris. The new target, 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, comes with promises to cut methane emissions in the oil and gas sector, and regulations for natural gas power plants and fertilizer production. In November, just weeks after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the Liberals win the election and take office, Canada signs the Paris agreement at that UN conference, using the same Conservative targets. 2016: Trudeau surprises and angers some premiers with a sudden plan to impose a minimum price on pollution on provinces without their own similar plan. Shortly after, most provinces sign on the Pan-Canadian Framework for Clean Growth and Climate Change, which shows a path of policies to get Canada much of the way to the Paris target. They include the carbon price, as well as better building codes, eliminating coal power and a clean fuel standard to reduce emissions generated by burning fuels. 2020: Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson introduces a \u201cstrengthened\u201d climate plan aiming to introduce more measures to try and meet the original 2030 target and start working toward net-zero emissions by 2050. A Healthy Environment and a Healthy Economy promises to keep increasing the carbon price until it reaches $170 a tonne in 2030, and to invest in clean technology and a national clean electricity grid. 2021: Canada submits updated emissions targets to the UN, now aiming for 40 to 45 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. It also passes the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act, which enshrines the targets into law for the first time, and requires regular reporting and reviews of progress. 2022: Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault introduces the Emissions Reduction Plan, showing the path to getting to the new 2030 targets.

It also passes the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act, which enshrines the targets into law for the first time, and requires regular reporting and reviews of progress. 2022: Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault introduces the Emissions Reduction Plan, showing the path to getting to the new 2030 targets.

            "content": "Fit, fabric and design affect mask effectiveness. (Windsor Essex Sewing Force), Author providedEarly in the pandemic, mask-wearing policies were consistently associated with decreased transmission of SARS-CoV-2. At that time, the masks worn were generally made of cloth and often improvised. The highly-transmissible Omicron variant focused attention on mask performance. Although most provinces are lifting official mask mandates, we agree with public health authorities in recommending that people wear the best mask available. We have been working to improve and test reusable masks for community use. We are an interdisciplinary group of engineers, scientists, a doctor and a community mask-maker. We test novel personal protective equipment (PPE), advocate for mask use and summarize the best available evidence at clothmasks.org. Hierarchy of mask performance There is an accepted hierarchy of mask performance based on mask materials, certification standards and use, confirmed by a 2022 California population health study. The best protection is obtained by wearing a respirator such as an N95, CAN95 or CAN99, or in Europe, an FFP2 or FFP3. Performance is typically lower for KN95s, KF94s and certified medical masks meeting ASTM levels 1 to 3. (ASTM is an international standards organization.) Testing Essex-pleated cotton masks using a PortaCount fit tester at McMaster University. (Drouillard et. al. PLOS), Author provided The materials used in all these masks offer similar, excellent, aerosol filtration, but the masks differ in their fit and seal on the face, with KN95s and KF94s fitting better than certified medical masks. Cloth masks are typically ranked lower in their performance and may or may not be certified (for example, meeting ASTM-F3502 standard). However, we recently showed that well-fitted cloth masks comprising high quality two-ply cotton material can perform as well as Level 1 medical masks. Fabric types Some examples of the variations in fabric structure seen with scanning electron microscopy: A) Bandana, B) High quality quilting fabric, C) Tea towel, D) Bed sheet, E) Outer layer L1 nonwoven medical mask, F) Middle layer of L1 nonwoven medical mask. We found that pore diameter (the size of the gaps) and fabric weight predicted filtration, however consumers would not know the pore diameter for retail or wholesale cloth. For this reason, we focus on the categories used when cloth is sold, and recommend 100 per cent cotton quilters\u2019 fabric, fashion fabric and T-shirt fabric. (Drouillard et. al. PLOS), Author provided When health-care professionals are issued N95s or other certified respirators, they are fit tested to verify mask performance on the wearer. But fit testing is typically not an option for the public. Our research, explained in plain language here, underscores that fit can be achieved by good design and is as important as mask materials. For our research, we adapted the same method used in quantitative mask fit testing: a PortaCount fit tester that counts particles inside and outside the mask. We tested 16 different cottons from nine recognizable categories. All except bandana cotton showed filtration equivalent to a medical mask. These findings apply to the carefully designed two-layer cloth mask with ties we used \u2014 other masks that fit less well will not provide the same protection. Our results show that two-layer cotton masks made from quilters\u2019 cotton, fashion fabric and T-shirt fabric filtered 55 to 60 per cent of aerosol particles measuring one micron or smaller, the size relevant for infectious aerosol particles. This was similar to the performance of a Level 1 medical mask. The breathability of the two-layer cotton masks was also acceptable as per medical mask standards. This graph shows the filtration of two-layer masks, all the same design, worn by a human volunteer. All except bandana cotton showed filtration equivalent to a medical mask. Mass market QC = mass market quilting cotton, HQ QC = high quality quilting cotton, HQ Batik = high quality batik quilting fabric. The medical masks we tested are represented by dotted lines showing their 50 to 60 per cent filtration. (Drouillard et. al. PLOS), Author provided Filtration in the same range was provided by batiks, home d\u00e9cor fabric and bed-sheet fabric, but some examples of these materials failed the breathability testing. Tea towel fabrics also filtered well, but some were too thick to sew. Bandana fabrics performed worst at 46 per cent filtration. Fit and design A close fit at the ear prevents unfiltered air from entering the mask at the sides. (Drouillard et. al. PLOS), Author provided Our research showed that cloth masks performed similarly to medical masks because they fit better, were designed thoughtfully and had overhead ties. Although medical masks are composed of materials with better filtration performance, they exhibit greater leakage, with completely unfiltered air passing around the mask. As a test of breathability, we measured the pressure across fabrics using the same methods that are used for testing certified medical masks. The threshold for medical masks is shown with dotted lines. (Drouillard et. al. PLOS), Author provided The cloth masks included in past studies may have been haphazardly selected: their filtration, using the same methods that we used, was found to be between 23 and 52 per cent. A thoughtfully designed two-layer T-shirt mask with overhead ties, tested on human volunteers, filtered 50 per cent of aerosols, in keeping with our study, and again highlighting the importance of fit. To compare like with like, when we looked at other studies, the filtration percentages that we quote above were taken from studies using a similar design: protection of a human wearer, using particles 0.02 to 3 microns, 0.02 to 1 microns and 0.02 to 0.1 microns. Other studies examining source control, using mannikins and using larger particles come to similar conclusions. Good masks fit well, with minimal obvious leaking at the edges. Nosewires, overhead ties or earloop adjusters all contribute to fit. Two layers or more, and a middle layer of non-woven polypropylene improve overall filtration. Masks meeting the new U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention standard for community masks, ASTM-F3502, are likely to filter well, though generally not as well as respirators. N95 masks Hospitals report that the current supply of N95-type masks meets but doesn\u2019t exceed demand, and supply of these masks is insufficient for the general population. Access and cost issues require public health and economic solutions along with consideration of environmental impact of disposable PPE. If buying respirators for personal use, we recommend buying only what you need and practising extended reuse. If buying KN95s and equivalent certified medical masks, we advise paying close attention to the fit of the mask. We recommend double masking medical masks or using minor modifications or mask hacks that enhance fit and reduce leakage. Pattern and instructions for the Essex pleated mask \u2014 a two-layer, three-pleat design created by the Windsor-Essex Sewing Force \u2014 are available from wesf.ca. (Windsor Essex Sewing Force), Author provided Carefully designed, well-fitting, multilayer reusable cloth masks still have an important ongoing role in reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, especially in lower risk settings. Protection is highest and transmission is lowest when everyone wears masks, because masks both protect the wearer while also reducing the number of contaminated particles reaching the environment (source control). There are important reductions to individual risk from wearing any mask, which have been observed in the community and quantified in the lab. We can protect ourselves, others and vulnerable people. Let\u2019s all wear the best mask available.

            "full_description": "Lucas Joppa, Microsoft's chief environmental officer, speaks at the Techonomy Climate conference. Stephen Shankland/CNET Microsoft is trying to reverse its lifetime carbon emissions , the total amount of the greenhouse gas it's responsible for sending into the atmosphere since its founding in 1975. To get there, it needs more companies it can pay to capture carbon dioxide from the air . That's the word from Lucas Joppa, Microsoft's chief environmental officer, speaking at the Techonomy Climate conference Tuesday. Carbon capture is expensive and can't operate at anything like the scale needed to pull significant amounts of carbon dioxide out of the air. Microsoft wants to buy carbon capture services in part to advance the technology and bring its costs down. \"The market can barely support Microsoft's demands. There's just not enough supply,\" Joppa said of carbon capture. \"That's fine now, kind of, but it's not fine for 2030. It's not fine for 2050. The rest of corporate America needs to get into this game.\" His call to action represents one facet of the tech industry's attempt to wrestle with climate change. That includes efforts to cut the industry's own climate footprint -- for example, Google's efforts to shift to renewable energy sources -- and to capitalize directly with businesses that profit from fixing the climate. At stake is whether humans can fight the climate change we've caused and its dangers: extreme weather events like storms, more heat, more drought and plunging biodiversity. Microsoft is applying its purchasing power to carbon capture. \"We came along and said we want a million metric tons. That blew the lid off the market,\" Joppa said. \"We bought 1.3 million metric tons in the first year. That was the vast majority of what the world had to offer.\" Idealab Studio Chief Executive Bill Gross, another Techonomy speaker, helped create one startup working the problem, CarbonCapture . Gross hopes it'll eventually pull carbon out of the air economically and at large scale to lower carbon dioxide to the levels it was decades ago. \"We have to go backward in time if we want to give the same Earth I inherited to my children and grandchildren,\" Gross said.

            "content": "Since inception, Y Combinator has invested in thousands of startups, and more recently, even hundreds within a single batch. Given the accelerator\u2019s growth, competitive tensions feel nearly inevitable. Still, one has to wonder if there is a fundamental shift afoot. Whereas YC always backed companies that might at some point overlap, the outfit appeared to casting its net far and wide, bringing in different startups at different stages from different geographies \u2013 companies that used each other\u2019s products, in fact, and formed tight bonds through YC\u2019s active alumni network. Now, however, YC seems to be actively leaning into startups that are roughly the same age, operating in the same countries, and targeting exactly the same opportunity with nearly identical business models. Indeed, while similar types of companies within a class had grown inescapable as YC\u2019s class sizes have ballooned, a kind of sameness is more apparent than ever with it latest batch of 400 startups. In fact, it\u2019s beginning to look like the plan here is to back as many nascent rival teams as possible \u2013 then let them duke it out. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Y Combinator sees things differently. At least, asked about the many startups that would seem to compete from the outset, a spokeswoman for YC writes in an email: \u201cThese companies are not in the same groups and do not interact. Also, it is common for startups to pivot during the batch.\u201d In the meantime, we\u2019ve rounded up some of the startups that seem to us to overlap \u2013 a lot \u2013 within its Winter 2022 batch. *** TradeX and Better Opinions Founded in the same year and same location, TradeX and Better Opinions have the same goal: give people a way to bet \u2013 and win \u2013 money on their predictions. The startups are building platforms where people can trade money while betting on whether or not an outcome will happen, from a movie launch to who the next president will be. There are more serious future events to bet on as well, such as climate change, inflation and whether omicron cases will rise or fall in a particular location. The only clear difference between the two companies is that TradeX is targeting higher income Indians and Better Opinions is branding itself more around inclusivity and accessibility. Firezone and NetMaker As early as 2018, our own Romain Dillet was making his own VPN server using Wireguard, a faster and more secure alternative to existing VPN software. Firezone and Netmaker, both participants in this batch of Y Combinator startups, are open source VPNs built atop WireGuard. Netmaker claims it\u2019s 15x faster than OpenVPN, a popular VPN software, while Firezone says it\u2019s 4x faster. But speed isn\u2019t everything \u2013 the competitor cohort-mates will have to battle it out to offer better customer service, firewall options and ease of use than the other. Both startups have a free plan and a paid plan for larger business teams, but neither company is sharing pricing for these paid plans, so we can\u2019t compare their price points just yet. Streak and Yodaa Consider that Streak and Yodaa are both less than two years old, both based in Bangalore, and both trying to build banking businesses that cater to teenagers by both educating them on their spending and helping them to save. (Both also offer a gamified approach, wherein kids can earn coins for certain spending behaviors.) It\u2019s fairly plain these two will be vying for the same customers, who probably won\u2019t be using two different banking apps. (More here.) India dominates Y Combinator\u2019s latest startup batch (again) Finku and Pina and Sribuu All three of these companies are personal financial advisor startups that are based in Jakarta and have been founded in the last year or two. Yes, Indonesia is a big market, but also, come on. Tradezi and Anfin Tradezi is a months-old, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam-based startup that calls itself the \u201cRobinhood for Southeast Asia.\u201d What it does (or will do): offers free online trading accounts that allows users to invest in stocks, crypto, and other alternative assets in one place. It sounds a lot like Anfin, which is a year-old, Ho Chi Minh City-based startup that\u2019s building a digital brokerage in Vietnam connecting users to the stock market in \u201ca simple and intuitive way.\u201d Investors could sign up for both companies\u2019 brokerage accounts, but would they? Clupp and Momento The insurance market, particularly for vehicles, is far from saturated in Latin America, with just 30% of cars and 10% of motorcycles covered, according to Clupp, an online insurance startup that was founded in 2021 and is based in Mexico City. Indeed, Clupp sees a big opportunity in providing more affordable insurance for low-risk drivers in Latin America. And so does Momento, which was also founded in 2021 and based in Mexico City and is also looking to insure the region\u2019s drivers and motorcycle riders. The big difference (for now): Momento says it is working through the regulatory process to be a fully licensed insurance carrier; Clupp appears to be working with a fully licensed insurance carrier to offer its products (Mapfre for cars and HDI for motorcycles). Naturally, even startups with a different take may be jockeying for the space soon enough. As we have seen with fintech especially, all financial technology products go horizontal until they blur. This is why SoFi now features stock investing, Robinhood offers a debit card, and so forth. Once you go through the work of bringing in a consumer into the fold, you want them to sell them as many products as possible \u2014 so you keep adding. That means that regardless of where this cohort is starting (some are robo advisors, some Robinhood-clones, some neobanks, some insuretech, many are tackling carbon emissions) , Y Combinator has invested money and energy into numerous companies that could find themselves competing with one another sooner rather than later. While they may form friendships and become one another\u2019s customers, you can also easily foresee, in some markets, more battle royale than mere dustup.",

Before this year, YC hadn\u2019t backed a food delivery startup in Africa. So it was a bit surprising to see two of this type of company \u2014 beU delivery and Heyfood \u2014 in a single batch. We understand that YC is excited to back food delivery businesses after seeing DoorDash go public . These startups operate in far apart African markets \u2014 beU delivery in Ethiopia, and Heyfood in Nigeria\u2013 but over time, they\u2019ll expand into similar markets and compete for the same customers in their bids to become the region\u2019s top delivery platform. Both platforms, founded in 2021 and based in Lagos, play in the identity verification space. Dojah claims to be an \u201call-in-one know-your-customer (KYC) and identity verification platform for Africa,\u201d while Identity Pass says its infrastructure makes it possible for digital businesses in Africa to \u201ceasily verify their customers within seconds.\u201d It\u2019s easy to assume that the market is enormous for both players \u2014 and others, however, customers will have to choose one of two services or switch periodically depending on speed, level of insights they offer, who fights fraud better and price points. Naturally, even startups with a different take may be jockeying for the space soon enough. As we have seen with fintech especially, all financial technology products go horizontal until they blur . This is why SoFi now features stock investing, Robinhood offers a debit card, and so forth.

            "content": "Yet again, India is the most represented country, outside of the United States, within the latest Y Combinator accelerator batch: the Winter 2022 cohort sports 32 startups hailing from Gurugram, Bengaluru, Delhi, New Delhi, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Chennai. For what it\u2019s worth, more than 191 companies in India have been funded through the Y Combinator accelerator, with nearly half \u2014 half! \u2014 of those companies accepted in the last 12 months. This batch\u2019s companies, as we\u2019ll discuss below, plan to tackle a diverse range of challenges within tech, but appear concentrated mostly within the financial services sector. Think \u2018buy now, pay later\u2019 pitches, savings-focused neobanks and, of course, bitcoin bets. It\u2019s a contrast from prior showings, in which most of India\u2019s YC startups fell into the B2B services category, but as we\u2019ve seen, fintech is on fire in terms of valuations and investor appetite \u2013 even despite a broader market correction. Other trends of note include a smattering of companies from Accel Atoms, a pre-seed program for early-stage founders in India, as well as many, many IIT graduates. Here\u2019s a list of all W22 startups: TradeX Founded: 2021 in Gurugram, Haryana, India Team: Divij Goyal, the former founder of CityMall \u2013 which is a half a billion dollar social commerce business \u2013 and a poker player. Indrajeet Roy, an industrial engineer graduate from IIT Delhi and former founder of Hoi Foods, which they say is India\u2019s fifth largest cloud kitchen company Ankit Shrivastava, an app developer, part-time trader in the Indian stock market, and a techie who has worked across PwC and JPMC in the past. What they\u2019re building: A kind of futures market where people can trade money while betting on whether or not an outcome will happen, from a movie launch to who the next president will be. There are more serious future events to bet on, too, such as climate change, inflation and omicron cases. Key quote: \u201cAllowing people to trade on what they know rather than studying company financials or worrying about market conditions. We are making opinions investable,\u201d the company wrote on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. TC Quick Take: We know that alternative asset investing is gaining momentum, thanks to collectibles, NFTs and apparently even private equity funds. TradeX is betting that futures markets \u2014 which have been tried in the past but failed to generate enough interest from investors to succeed \u2014 will find an audience, too. It might have found inspiration in Kalshi, a U.S. startup that is similarly hoping to entice a new generation of traders to bet on all kinds of possible outcomes (and that has itself raised money from Sequoia Capital, Henry Kravis, and Charles Schwab). TradeX has already raised $1 million in seed funding, per Entrackr. GoSats Founded: 2020 in Bengaluru, India Team: Roshni Aslam is a former research and investment analyst turned co-founder. Mohammed Roshan is an early bitcoin adopter who has held executive positions at a number of Indian crypto companies, including the title of founder at SaffronCoin. What they\u2019re building: The startup combines the idea of cash-back rewards with crypto. Key quote: \u201cWe help people accumulate free bitcoin as cash back and rewards every time they shop in India,\u201d the company wrote on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. Our thoughts: The startup previously went through Atoms, Accel\u2019s pre-seed funding program and that claims GoSats already has an 85,000 person community with 1,000 new users coming every day. By avoiding going the exchange route, and instead sitting on top of how people use and transact in both coins and cash, GoSats could be a ripe acquisition target \u2013 or a platform that brings a services business to crypto. Image Credits: PixelChoice (opens in a new window) / Getty Images Better Opinions Founded: 2021 in Gurugram, India. Team: Soumyajit Das, co-founder and CTO of Better Opinions, previously worked at some of the biggest international startups, including Gojek, PayTm, Meesho and Decathlon. They previously built a social startup for donating household items for charity. Samay Jain also worked at Gojek as a product lead, and before that was an IIT Kharagpur graduate. The now co-founder says he has been an active trader for over three years. What they\u2019re building: A platform for users to trade opinions and win money if they\u2019re right. The prediction platform lets folks bet on everyday topics, such as COVID-19 case rates or the winner of tonight\u2019s cricket game. Key quote: \u201cWhen we start allowing trading in categories such as cricket, politics and entertainment, not only do we make trading more relatable, but we also help improve their financial literacy,\u201d the company wrote on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. Our thoughts: Are we missing something? Better Opinions feels like a direct competitor to TradeX. OurEye.ai Founded: 2020 in Bengaluru, India Team: Miran Junaidi, a recent UC Berkeley graduate with teaching and research experience in artificial intelligence, is a co-founder of the startup. Sourav Sanyal, also a co-founder of OurEye.ai, previously studied computer science and began an entertainment company for teenagers. What they\u2019re building: A way for brick-and-mortar shops to audit videos for standard operating procedures. The company uses artificial intelligence through CCTV cameras to monitor quality and make faster business decisions. Our thoughts: We like the idea of your neighborhood bodega catching up with real-time alerts when it comes to walk-ins, customers, and, heck, floor mopping compliance. It\u2019s just, ultimately, we\u2019d love to see the remote auditing company boast more privacy and user security shout outs on their website. Fello Founded: 2021 in Bengaluru, India Team: CTO and Co-founder Shourya Lala is a computer science engineer and app developer who previously built financial tools for BlackRock. Manish Maryada, founder and CEO of Fello, spent time scaling early-stage fintech startups before launching one of his own. He focuses on product management, growth, operations and strategy. What they\u2019re building: Already having raised $1 million in seed backing, Fello is a gaming and finance application that helps India\u2019s Gen Z and young millennials learn how to save money. Users can save and invest in financial assets, and also win money if they win games. Key quote: \u201cJust within a short span of 12 weeks of launch, we onboarded 250,000 users with 92% of them being referred users, 88% of them being first-time investors who are spending over 12 minutes on an average per day on the app saving and playing games together!\u201d the company wrote on the Y combinator blog. Our thoughts: Personal finance clearly matters internationally, however savings with a twist isn\u2019t quite a new pitch. Fello needs a big differentiator to win sticky traction amid a competitive landscape, whether that\u2019s an accessible user experience or a smart way to pitch its vision. Telematica Founded: 2021 in Bengaluru, India Team: CEO Abhishek Jain previously founded EdMad, a bootcamp for software engineering interviews, and worked at Adobe. Aditya Ketkar, CTO at Telematica, held the same role at Jain\u2019s previous company EdMad and worked at Microsoft and Amazon. What they\u2019re building: Self-described as a \u201cPlaid for electric vehicles,\u201d Telematica is building an API tool to bring the cloud to the burgeoning automotive subscription industry. Companies, using Telematica, can access the telematics, battery, and other mobility data of cars and control EV charging with one API. Key quote: \u201cThe thing that fascinates us is that virtually 100% of them are connected to the cloud, which captures and stores telematics, battery, and other mobility data. Unfortunately, there is no easy way for companies to interact with them as there is no user-friendly API or developer portal provided by any brand. For all of these vehicles, we create a single, standardized API,\u201d the company wrote on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. Our thoughts: The company claims that India\u2019s electric vehicle market is growing, estimating that more than 40% of new car sales are expected to be electric by 2030. If this is the case, the early bet on the API that makes those cars work and can address their maintenance and fuel needs, could certainly be a big opportunity. Material Depot Founded: 2021 in Bengaluru, India Team: Manish Reddy, Material Depot\u2019s co-founder, is a former BCG consultant joined by Sarthak Agrawal. What they\u2019re building: An online index where consumers can discover, organize, and order materials to enhance interior design efforts. The platform is made for construction and creative professionals. Since the company\u2019s launch in January, per the co-founder, more than 5,000 architects and designers have joined the platform. Key quote: \u201cWhen there is so much data, it\u2019s extremely important to ensure the discovery itself doesn\u2019t become a burden itself. Material Depot makes it easy to let go of all the catalogues and phone numbers in your directory and look up your favorite materials (with their detailed specifications) that are just a click away,\u201d the company\u2019s website states. Our thoughts: Material Depot sounds similar to services offered by Houzz, which has struggled to monetize its home renovation service in the past. However, Material Depot\u2019s focus on the enterprise instead of the consumer, and its scale of ambition, is noteworthy. The company wants to eventually focus on making the supply chain process more efficient, a need with a lot of monetary opportunity and clear demand. SaveIN Founded: 2020 in New Delhi, India Team: Co-founder Jitin Bhasin previously launched Rupeeredee, a fintech lending company that he claims delivered millions in revenue along with profitability. The entrepreneur has 14 years of experience across banking, finance, insurance and consulting. Co-founder Gaurav Luthra has also spent time launching and building other companies prior to this one, including What\u2019s Up Life and Genie Agro Foods. This appears to be his first foray into the specific world of fintech and neobanks. Former EY and Deutsche Bank manager Anurag Varma is the third co-founder of SaveIN. Varma has spent years around the world advising local and global banks on business strategy as well as large scale front-to-back digital and process transformation engagements, his LinkedIn states. What they\u2019re building: A healthcare company focused on affordability. The startup wants to give more consumers the \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d option when it comes to healthcare bills and other big ticket expenses. Key quote: \u201c80% Indians have no health insurance and 50% Indians are unable to pay for private healthcare,\u201d the company wrote on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. \u201cWe are targeting 100 [million] urban Indians who undertake on an average 1 healthcare procedure per year costing $200. This is a $20B dollar market opportunity.\u201d Our thoughts: Within the United States, there\u2019ve been many swings at repayment services over the years, especially in health care. It makes sense: the bills are confusing, antiquated and often inaccessible based on how expensive a simple service can be. SaveIN wants to bring that model to India, which has its own challenges around billing and repayment. The big focus for SaveIN should be to gain provider trust as it seeks to optimize decades-long inefficiencies. AntWalk Founded: 2019 in Bengaluru, India. Team: Before trying to disrupt productivity, co-founder Sriramkumar Sundararaman spent more than a decade working for engineering, IT service, telecom and BFSI clients including Jio, Joybroto Ganguly, also a co-founder of the company, is a former McKinsey manager and edtech talent upstart founder. What they\u2019re building: AntWalk is an employee up-skilling platform for enterprises. The company helps employees develop their skill sets and gain new experience across roles including sales, customer success, general management and product. Key quote: \u201cAn up-skilling platform that empowers teams with continuous learning tracks to equip them with the right skills at the right time,\u201d the company said on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. Our thoughts: Finally, an edtech company! As with any up-skilling platform, AntWalk\u2019s success is only as powerful as its outcomes, and it\u2019s unclear how the business tracks the impact of its courses. Elevating productivity levels and enhancing leadership qualities are strong pitches, and the company is smartly using a mix of live and asynchronous cohort-based learning to scale those teachings. We\u2019re most interested in its claim of 1:1 interactions, meaning that employees may be given access to mentors and experts during certain times of the week. That \u2014 if scaled \u2014 could make for a real difference in efficacy. Legistify Founded: 2016 in Gurugram, India. Team: CEO Akshat Singhal has been working for the company for over six years. Before that, though, they had experience dealing with another complex industry: restaurants, and the evergreen challenges of booking tables online. Singhal has also worked in marketing, sales and education. Pratik Mohapatra, the co-founder and business development lead of Legistify, helps manage litigation portfolios for Indian corporations. What they\u2019re building: One of the oldest startup\u2019s in this batch\u2019s India cohort, the 50-person software company wants to make it easier for companies to handle small legal disputes. Per Legistify\u2019s website, the company has 7,000 registered lawyers, 10,000 covered courts, and has handled over 100,000 cases. Key quote: \u201cThese companies have billions of dollars stuck in millions of such disputes that could easily be tracked and settled through our software,\u201d the company stated on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. Our thoughts: Legal tech startups have long tried to bring order to a fragmented industry, so Legistify\u2019s pitch isn\u2019t too hard to understand. After all, every startup doesn\u2019t need the same level of input and white-glove legal service (one might simply be incorporating a company, while another is filing a lawsuit, for example). We\u2019d to see how Legistify monetizes its service, since flexibility for lawyers \u2013 and the rise of virtual practices \u2013 could create some competitive tensions. Image: Bryce Durbin / TechCrunch Blitzllama Founded: 2021 in Bengaluru, India. Team: Co-founder Joel John Koshy has spent time as the head of product on an influencer e-commerce platform, and as the founder of a charity fundraising platform. Also a serial entrepreneur \u2013 who has spent time at Zynga and IIT Bombay \u2013 Rahul Mallapur cares about product life cycles, regardless of if they\u2019re in games, social networks, or nonprofits. Bently Nixon, co-founder and CTO at Blitzllama, has built a number of startups in education, publishing, food and other sectors. What they\u2019re building: A better way for product teams to collect feedback from users. Blitzllama is building a SDK integration that can let teams ask questions throughout a product experience, and then tailor products accordingly. The company boasts a 32% average response rate from users, and tracks over 200,000 monthly responses. Key quote: \u201cWith only a simple SDK integration, teams can ask questions to their users within product journeys and get highly contextual answers in minutes. This empowers teams to ship products that address users\u2019 real problems,\u201d the company wrote on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. Our thoughts: The no-code tool is a different, perhaps more direct take on community-first building. Right now, the service\u2019s goal does feel simple, but can be tailored to fit client UI and user language preferences. It also provides one platform for companies to gain user research, instead of stringing together a bunch of different tools. Long term, Blitzllama will need to prove how it can be more proactive or tailored in gaining feedback. PayCrunch Founded: 2020 in Bengaluru, India. Team: Aman Bhayana spent years studying and working in computer and information systems, before catching the entrepreneurship bug and founding PayCrunch. What they\u2019re building: A UPI-based payments service that provides a pay later option to college students. The company says it uses alternative credit scoring models to get credit to a wider audience. Key quote: \u201cMore than 150 million people in India are not able to access formal credits in India either because of lack of financial data or low credit scores,\u201d the company said on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. \u201cWe use alternative credit scoring models to provide a Pay Later option on UPI to a wider audience.\u201d Our thoughts: Micro loan lending is a common way that we see accessibility and fintech companies overlap. In PayCrunch\u2019s case, it is relying on a unified payments interface, a system that can bring multiple bank accounts, fund routes and payments into one app. It claims it\u2019s the first company to bring this technology to students in India (which we can\u2019t verify) but again, it\u2019s easy to see a massive potential customer base with this one. Requestly Founded: 2021 in New Delhi, India. Team: CEO and co-founder Sachin Jain has spent over a decade working with companies including Google, Adobe and Grofers. The avid hackathon attendee actually stumbled into the idea for Requestly when working on a side project \u2013 and of course, the idea eventually became the startup that was accepted into YC. Also an avid builder, Sagar Soni has launched web apps on web, mobile and desktop and worked at more than four startups. Soni, now co-founder and CTO of Requestly, founder, also founded two companies, casually. What they\u2019re building: A way to record and modify APIs without developers needing to touch the back-end. It is available as a browser extension and a desktop app, and claims it is already in production with over 40,000 developers across over 500 organizations. Key quote: \u201cAs an Uber engineer, I\u2019d like to test what happens when driver allotment API fails, is there an automatic retry or do we ask the user to retry, or does the app crash,\u201d the company said on Y Combinator\u2019s blog post. Our thoughts: API startups have exploded (and thus fragmented) over the past few years. Requestly is smart to try to bring some sort of unification, and ease, to managing those different tools from a higher level. Kaagaz Founded: 2019 in New Delhi, India Team: Back-end developer turned co-founder, Tamanjit Bindra has built a bunch of businesses, including one that wants to help people have happier homes. He says he loves B2C and scale, even if that\u2019s where \u201ceverything breaks.\u201d Snehanshu Gandhi is a serial entrepreneur who graduated from IIT Bombay and co-founded a productivity tool before co-founding Kaagaz. This also isn\u2019t Gaurav Shrishrimal\u2019s first time hearing the word entrepreneur: the repeat founder now leads growth and marketing at Kaagaz. What they\u2019re building: A suite of services for mobile-first businesses, specifically focused on managing documents via smartphones. The company says it has 3 million monthly active users over the last 18 months and grows that number at 10% per month. It has 2,000 paying customers to date. Key quote: \u201cWith over 200M such businesses in India, at $15/year subscription price, this a $3B opportunity in India & much larger globally,\u201d the company wrote on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. Our thoughts: Document scanning and cloud storage feels like a niche solution, so it will be interesting see how Kaagaz expands from here. A strength, presumably, is definitely ease of use, given that you can modify documents from your phone. Edustack Founded: 2021 in Hyderabad, India. Team: Vamsee Koneru previously bootstrapped, built and sold a revenue-generating company in the education system. Prudhvi Raj has helped build a number of tech startups, including Zylotech and QuantumGraph, with a product scale mindset. What they\u2019re building: An operating system for Indian classrooms. Edustack helps teachers assign digitized worksheets, and also send reminders, evaluate, and track engagement of those assignments. It\u2019s free for teachers to use, and sells its platform \u2013 which includes customized worksheets and a consultant \u2013 to schools. Key quote: \u201cEdustack saves 1000\u2019s of hours for teachers by helping them to assign digitized worksheets, send reminders, automate evaluation and instantaneously generate analytics. Digital worksheets are our wedge,\u201d the company wrote on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. Our thoughts: Interactive worksheets can\u2019t be where Edustack stops \u2014 after all, stack is in its name. We\u2019re interested in seeing how Edustack builds more proactive and student-centered services into its platform, which smartly wants to digitize the antiquated paper-and-pen style school day. Testing and tutoring would be easy pivots, but, heck, surprise us! Tingo Founded: 2021 in Gurugram, India. Team: Co-founder Sandilya Miduthuri was a former software engineer at Microsoft, Flipkart and Qualcomm and a student from IIT-Hyderabad. Chalam PVS, CEO and co-founder of Tingo, led data science and machine learning at Snapdeal, Fareportal and was also an IIT graduate. Both are highly technical, startup-minded entrepreneurs. What they\u2019re building: Self-described as a \u201cnext generation social dialer app,\u201d Tingo lets people set video ringtones for friends and family. While that may sound niche, its vision is much broader (and expands beyond India). Tingo wants to give users a whole new caller experience and app to use to connect with their close friends Key quote: \u201cEvery day over 40K people use Tingo to set video ringtones for their friends and family. We are growing at 17% weekly and [have] handled 25M+ phone calls through the app in the last 2 month,\u201d the company wrote on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. Our thoughts: The moonshot of the company is that it can convince India, and eventually the world, to use a new app when trying to get in touch with friends. It\u2019s a social media play built atop short-form video, a form factor that we\u2019ve already seen proven out with the rise of TikTok (which, obviously, continues to be a dominant force and could prove hard to topple). Image Credits: Bryce Durbin InsureMyTeam Founded: 2021 in Mumbai, India Team size: 11 Founders: Kunal Popat is co-founder of InsureMyTeam. His previous 15 years of working in the insurance industry and his passion of technology motivated Popat and his founder to start InsureMyTeam. Rachit Puri has 11 years of experience building health tech and fintech products at PayU and Paytm before co-founding InsureMyTeam. What they\u2019re building: An employee healthcare platform for companies in India enables employees to access unlimited health consultation and traditional hospital expenses. Key quote: \u201cEmployers provide health insurance, but it is insufficient for most, we also offer an easy way for employees to expand their coverage,\u201d the company wrote on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. Our thoughts: The Covid pandemic has spurred the need for greater access to a comprehensive healthcare benefit than only traditional hospital expenses. InsureMyTeam says it posted $16,000 in revenue and grew at 38% month-over-month over the past 5 months. The founders\u2019 experience in insurance, healthcare, and fintech sectors could prove helpful to operate the insurtech startup. SALT Founded: 2020 in Bengaluru, India Team size: 14 Founders: \u00b7 Udita Pal, an early team member of Opentalk, Tapchief and Manch, worked with more than 35 startups across the global as a consultant \u00b7 Ankit Parasher, an IIT Kharagpur graduate and a former co-founder of logistics platform LetsTransport, founded SALT. What they\u2019re building: A platform that provides cross-border payments and compliance for small and medium-size businesses. The company offers banking, document management and workflow automation to companies that handle international transactions. SALT has raised a $500,000 seed round last October, as per Times of India. Key quote: \u201cSALT is a neo banking solution stitched together to ease payments and documentation which comes with business banking by moving it to a digital-first and automated end to end platform,\u201d the company wrote on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. Our thoughts: As India\u2019s exports hit the $400 billion mark for the first time for fiscal year of 2022, more robust cross-border banking and compliance service providers for businesses will be needed. SALT could be one of the companies that make the international transaction easier. RecordBook Founded: 2021 in Bengaluru, India Team size: 10 Founders: RecordBook CEO Abhishek Choudhary, an IIT Kanpur graduate and former founder of Foodmonk, says he\u2019s passionate about SaaS and the marketplace. Choudhary co-founded RecordBook last year.

What they\u2019re building: RecordBook, a mobile and SaaS-based application, enables small and medium corporations to digitize all business data and workflows. Key quote: \u201cRecordBook is one stop solution to manage all business data, workflows and teams for small and medium businesses on their mobile devices and in their local languages,\u201d the company wrote on Y Combinator\u2019s blog.

Four undergraduate students at the National Institute of Technology Tiruchy founded BharaX. \u00b7 Shyam Murugan is co-founder of BharatX. \u00b7 Eeshan Sharma is co-founder and COO of BharatX. \u00b7 Siddharth Venu, co-founder of BharatX, says he loves building tech and watching anime. What they\u2019re building: The company enables low-income persons in India to get credit via consumer-facing apps. BharatX has raised a $250k pre-seed round last year, per mint. Key quote: \u201cWe operate our Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) in a white-labelled manner on other apps and websites,\u201d the company said on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. Our thoughts: This fintech startup wants to capture a niche market the banks couldn\u2019t provide\u2013 access to credit to every lower-income Indian with a zero-document flow. BharatX keeps expanding its service to pay later for food delivery and ride-hailing apps. RedBrick AI Founded: 2020 in Pune, India Team size: 9 Founders: Derek Lukacs, co-founder and CTO of RedBrick AI, previously co-founded the SpaceX Hyperloop pod competition team at the University of Michigan, where he graduated in aerospace engineering.

What they\u2019re building: The company is building an AI SaaS platform that offers web-based medical annotation tools for 2D and 3D data. RedBrick AI\u2019s tool, which automates up to 80% of iterative manual labeling, enables easy work for its customers and external labelers. Medical image annotation is the process of labeling medical imaging data, including X-Ray, CT, MRI scans, or ultrasound. Key quote: \u201cThe RedBrick configurable workflow system helps teams build robust and scalable quality assurance processes. RedBrick AI offers a suite of APIs to help developers consume the annotations being created, and integrate with MLOps,\u201d the company wrote on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. Our thoughts: Artificial intelligence (AI) can analyze a large amount of data in images stored by healthcare organizations. Health professionals will be able to save time, make better-informed decisions, and avoid potential errors through Redbrick AI\u2019s tool. Streak Founded: 2020 in Bengaluru, India Team size: 7 Founders: \u00b7 Shiv Bidani, co-founder of Streak, worked at PwC India prior to founding Streak. \u00b7 Balaji R, co-founder of Streak, says he\u2019s \u201ca hard-core engineer with experience in disturbed systems and databases.\u201d \u00b7 Mitul Mehta, former CEO of BoxMyLook, a subscription-based fashion service, co-founded Streak.

Key quote: \u201cAt Streak, we are building a new age personalized & gamified banking solution for teenagers,\u201d the company wrote on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. Our thoughts: This startup sounds like another edu-fintech startup for teens in the batch (see Yodaa at the very bottom) to help young adults save money and get smart with money. Castled Data Founded: 2021 in Bengaluru, India Team size: 10 Founders: Franklin George, co-founder of Castled Data, whose background is in engineering, started his entrepreneurial journey with Castled Data.

According to The Economic Times, retailers and quick-service restaurant chains opened four new stores in India almost every day last year. With Covid restrictions easing in India, it is expected that more companies might have plans to open their offline offices and use 91Squarefeet\u2019s platform. Shopr.tv Founded: 2021 in Bengaluru, India Team size: 10 Founders: Mukul Anand, co-founder and CPO of Shopr.tv, previously worked as head of product at sports gaming app FanFight where Anand met his current co-founders.

Co-founder and COO Akshay Suhag also built and scaled FanFight (to $7 million in yearly revenue) before it was acquired. He is an avid sports fan, especially Cricket, Football, and Formula 1. What they\u2019re building: Shopr.tv, a live commerce platform, is Twitch for fashion and beauty, where creators can broadcast, build an audience, and monetize by selling over live streams. The startup says it has a strong partner pipeline, with over 70 creators and 12 brands whose products these creators can sell. Key quote: \u201cWe are Twitch for Fashion and Beauty, where creators can broadcast, build an audience, and monetize by selling over live streams,\u201d the company wrote on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. Our thoughts: The experienced co-founders are targeting a huge market, one that brings together live-streaming, e-commerce, and social networking. Shopr.tv claims that the slice of the beauty and fashion industry that it\u2019s targeting is valued at $24 billion (which seems low, actually), and has 150 million consumers. Meanwhile, the young startup plans to make money by taking a 10-12% cut on every sale. Image: Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch Fieldproxy Founded: 2020 in Chennai, India Team size: 15 Founders: Balakrishna Balasubramanian, co-founder of Fieldproxy, says he loves working on new products and ideas.

What they\u2019re building: NinjaStudy is building an AI-driven English-speaking tutor app that helps English learners across the globe practice and learn English speaking with feedback on users\u2019 grammar, pronunciation and fluency. Key quote: \u201cYou can imagine this as Siri/Alexa for learning and practicing English speaking,\u201d the company wrote on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. Our thoughts: NinjaStudy says it enables non-native English speakers to learn and practice English. They can use the app as if they are talking to Alex or Siri; an AI tutor will then correct users\u2019 grammar, pronunciation, etc. Based on its website, NinjaStudy seems still to be working on its beta app, which is aimed at adults. When it\u2019s out, we\u2019d like to see whether it indeed offers unique features compared with its peers. Vance Founded: 2021 in Mumbai, India Team size: 11 Founders: \u00b7 Parth Garg, co-founder and co-CEO at Vance, had dropped out of Stanford University to found startups. \u00b7 John Finkelman, co-founder and co-CEO of Vance, also dropped out of Stanford to found Vence in January 2022. What they\u2019re building: Vance says it is a pipe.com of India. Its platform is aimed at helping startups transform recurring revenue into upfront capital for growth without debt or dilution. Key quote: \u201cWe help companies unlock their recurring revenue upfront. This gives them the boost to grow without dilution, warrants and hassle.\u201d Our thoughts: Investors love this model. Just look at rival Pipe, which reached reached a valuation of $2 billion last May after raising $250 million. Notably, Pipe just launched in 2020. Harmoney Founded: 2021 in Mumbai, India Team size: 5 Founders: \u00b7 Before co-founding Harmoney, Amal Dani worked at Goldman Sachs and a $2 billion hedge fund as a quantitative strategist. Dani, a graduate at IIT Bombay in computer science, says he enjoys solving problems from a data and technology perspective. \u00b7 Omkar Ghaisas, co-founder of Harmoney, worked in the corporate finance and wealth management industry over the past 8 years. \u00b7 Aditya Mehta, co-founder of Harmoney, is a former quant at Goldman Sachs and a director in the core team at consumer lending platform Paysense, which PayU acquired for $185 million in 2020.

Our thoughts: Janani, which launched four months ago starting with at-home semen diagnostic, already generates about $8,000 revenue per month, growing 50% every month, the company wrote on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. Janani makes $60 per customer, targeting 130 million infertile Indians. The global fertility treatment market is expected to reach $21.7 billion in 2025 from $15.74 billion in 2021. Janani recently has raised $2.2 million from investors, including Y Combinator, Olive Tree Capital, and Goodwater Capital, as per The Economic Times.

The Yodaa app also offers fun quizzes for the teens.

Key quote: \u201cWith Yodaa, our customers get access to a prepaid card and a smart money app. Using Yodaa they can make payments, save money, split bills, get credit, invest and learn about wealth creation,\u201d the company said on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. Our thoughts: As mentioned above, Yodaa sounds like a direct competitor to Streak, which was founded a year earlier than Yodaa. The startup also lets teens learn about managing their money from the early years.",

            "full_description": "Yet again , India is the most represented country, outside of the United States, within the latest Y Combinator accelerator batch: the Winter 2022 cohort sports 32 startups hailing from Gurugram, Bengaluru, Delhi, New Delhi, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Chennai. For what it\u2019s worth, more than 191 companies in India have been funded through the Y Combinator accelerator, with nearly half \u2014 half! \u2014 of those companies accepted in the last 12 months. This batch\u2019s companies, as we\u2019ll discuss below, plan to tackle a diverse range of challenges within tech, but appear concentrated mostly within the financial services sector. Think \u2018buy now, pay later\u2019 pitches, savings-focused neobanks and, of course, bitcoin bets. It\u2019s a contrast from prior showings, in which most of India\u2019s YC startups fell into the B2B services category, but as we\u2019ve seen, fintech is on fire in terms of valuations and investor appetite \u2013 even despite a broader market correction. Other trends of note include a smattering of companies from Accel Atoms, a pre-seed program for early-stage founders in India, as well as many, many IIT graduates. Here\u2019s a list of all W22 startups: Founded: 2021 in Gurugram, Haryana, India Team: What they\u2019re building: A kind of futures market where people can trade money while betting on whether or not an outcome will happen, from a movie launch to who the next president will be. There are more serious future events to bet on, too, such as climate change, inflation and omicron cases. Key quote: \u201cAllowing people to trade on what they know rather than studying company financials or worrying about market conditions. We are making opinions investable,\u201d the company wrote on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. TC Quick Take: We know that alternative asset investing is gaining momentum, thanks to collectibles and NFTs. TradeX is betting that futures markets \u2014 which have been tried in the past but failed to generate enough interest from investors to succeed \u2014 will find an audience, too. It might have found inspiration in Kalshi , a U.S. startup that is similarly hoping to entice a new generation of traders to bet on all kinds of possible outcomes (and that has itself raised money from Sequoia Capital, Henry Kravis, and Charles Schwab). TradeX has already raised $1 million in seed funding , per Entrackr. Founded: 2020 in Bengaluru, India Team: What they\u2019re building : The startup combines the idea of cash-back rewards with crypto. Key quote: \u201cWe help people accumulate free bitcoin as cash back and rewards every time they shop in India,\u201d the company wrote on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. Our thoughts: The startup previously went through Atoms, Accel\u2019s pre-seed funding program and that claims GoSats already has an 85,000 person community with 1,000 new users coming every day. By avoiding going the exchange route, and instead sitting on top of how people use and transact in both coins and cash, GoSats could be a ripe acquisition target \u2013 or a platform that brings a services business to crypto. Image Credits: PixelChoice (opens in a new window) / Getty Images Founded: 2021 in Gurugram, India. Team: What they\u2019re building: A platform for users to trade opinions and win money if they\u2019re right. The prediction platform lets folks bet on everyday topics, such as COVID-19 case rates or the winner of tonight\u2019s cricket game. Key quote: \u201cWhen we start allowing trading in categories such as cricket, politics and entertainment, not only do we make trading more relatable, but we also help improve their financial literacy,\u201d the company wrote on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. Our thoughts: Are we missing something? Better Opinions feels like a direct competitor to TradeX. Founded: 2020 in Bengaluru, India Team: What they\u2019re building: A way for brick-and-mortar shops to audit videos for standard operating procedures. The company uses artificial intelligence through CCTV cameras to monitor quality and make faster business decisions. Our thoughts: We like the idea of your neighborhood bodega catching up with real-time alerts when it comes to walk-ins, customers, and, heck, floor mopping compliance. It\u2019s just, ultimately, we\u2019d love to see the remote auditing company boast more privacy and user security shout outs on their website. Founded: 2021 in Bengaluru, India Team: What they\u2019re building: Already having raised $1 million in seed backing, Fello is a gaming and finance application that helps India\u2019s Gen Z and young millennials learn how to save money. Users can save and invest in financial assets, and also win money if they win games. Key quote: \u201cJust within a short span of 12 weeks of launch, we onboarded 250,000 users with 92% of them being referred users, 88% of them being first-time investors who are spending over 12 minutes on an average per day on the app saving and playing games together!\u201d the company wrote on the Y combinator blog. Our thoughts: Personal finance clearly matters internationally, however savings with a twist isn\u2019t quite a new pitch. Fello needs a big differentiator to win sticky traction amid a competitive landscape, whether that\u2019s an accessible user experience or a smart way to pitch its vision. Founded: 2021 in Bengaluru, India Team: What they\u2019re building: Self-described as a \u201cPlaid for electric vehicles,\u201d Telematica is building an API tool to bring the cloud to the burgeoning automotive subscription industry. Companies, using Telematica, can access the telematics, battery, and other mobility data of cars and control EV charging with one API. Key quote: \u201cThe thing that fascinates us is that virtually 100% of them are connected to the cloud, which captures and stores telematics, battery, and other mobility data. Unfortunately, there is no easy way for companies to interact with them as there is no user-friendly API or developer portal provided by any brand. For all of these vehicles, we create a single, standardized API,\u201d the company wrote on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. Our thoughts: The company claims that India\u2019s electric vehicle market is growing, estimating that more than 40% of new car sales are expected to be electric by 2030. If this is the case, the early bet on the API that makes those cars work and can address their maintenance and fuel needs, could certainly be a big opportunity. Founded: 2021 in Bengaluru, India Team: What they\u2019re building: An online index where consumers can discover, organize, and order materials to enhance interior design efforts. The platform is made for construction and creative professionals. Since the company\u2019s launch in January, per the co-founder, more than 5,000 architects and designers have joined the platform. Key quote: \u201cWhen there is so much data, it\u2019s extremely important to ensure the discovery itself doesn\u2019t become a burden itself. Material Depot makes it easy to let go of all the catalogues and phone numbers in your directory and look up your favorite materials (with their detailed specifications) that are just a click away,\u201d the company\u2019s website states. Our thoughts: Material Depot sounds similar to services offered by Houzz, which has struggled to monetize its home renovation service in the past. However, Material Depot\u2019s focus on the enterprise instead of the consumer, and its scale of ambition, is noteworthy. The company wants to eventually focus on making the supply chain process more efficient, a need with a lot of monetary opportunity and clear demand. Founded: 2020 in New Delhi, India Team: What they\u2019re building: A healthcare company focused on affordability. The startup wants to give more consumers the \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d option when it comes to healthcare bills and other big ticket expenses. Key quote : \u201c80% Indians have no health insurance and 50% Indians are unable to pay for private healthcare,\u201d the company wrote on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. \u201cWe are targeting 100 [million] urban Indians who undertake on an average 1 healthcare procedure per year costing $200. This is a $20B dollar market opportunity.\u201d Our thoughts: Within the United States, there\u2019ve been many swings at repayment services over the years, especially in health care. It makes sense: the bills are confusing, antiquated and often inaccessible based on how expensive a simple service can be. SaveIN wants to bring that model to India, which has its own challenges around billing and repayment. The big focus for SaveIN should be to gain provider trust as it seeks to optimize decades-long inefficiencies. Founded: 2019 in Bengaluru, India. Team: What they\u2019re building: AntWalk is an employee up-skilling platform for enterprises. The company helps employees develop their skill sets and gain new experience across roles including sales, customer success, general management and product. Key quote: \u201c An up-skilling platform that empowers teams with continuous learning tracks to equip them with the right skills at the right time,\u201d the company said on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. Our thoughts: Finally, an edtech company! As with any up-skilling platform, AntWalk\u2019s success is only as powerful as its outcomes, and it\u2019s unclear how the business tracks the impact of its courses. Elevating productivity levels and enhancing leadership qualities are strong pitches, and the company is smartly using a mix of live and asynchronous cohort-based learning to scale those teachings. We\u2019re most interested in its claim of 1:1 interactions, meaning that employees may be given access to mentors and experts during certain times of the week. That \u2014 if scaled \u2014 could make for a real difference in efficacy. Founded: 2016 in Gurugram, India. Team: What they\u2019re building: One of the oldest startup\u2019s in this batch\u2019s India cohort, the 50-person software company wants to make it easier for companies to handle small legal disputes. Per Legistify\u2019s website, the company has 7,000 registered lawyers, 10,000 covered courts, and has handled over 100,000 cases. Key quote: \u201cThese companies have billions of dollars stuck in millions of such disputes that could easily be tracked and settled through our software,\u201d the company stated on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. Our thoughts: Legal tech startups have long tried to bring order to a fragmented industry , so Legistify\u2019s pitch isn\u2019t too hard to understand. After all, every startup doesn\u2019t need the same level of input and white-glove legal service (one might simply be incorporating a company, while another is filing a lawsuit, for example). We\u2019d to see how Legistify monetizes its service, since flexibility for lawyers \u2013 and the rise of virtual practices \u2013 could create some competitive tensions. Image: Bryce Durbin / TechCrunch Founded: 2021 in Bengaluru, India. Team: What they\u2019re building: A better way for product teams to collect feedback from users. Blitzllama is building a SDK integration that can let teams ask questions throughout a product experience, and then tailor products accordingly. The company boasts a 32% average response rate from users, and tracks over 200,000 monthly responses. Key quote: \u201cWith only a simple SDK integration, teams can ask questions to their users within product journeys and get highly contextual answers in minutes. This empowers teams to ship products that address users\u2019 real problems,\u201d the company wrote on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. Our thoughts: The no-code tool is a different, perhaps more direct take on community-first building. Right now, the service\u2019s goal does feel simple, but can be tailored to fit client UI and user language preferences. It also provides one platform for companies to gain user research, instead of stringing together a bunch of different tools. Long term, Blitzllama will need to prove how it can be more proactive or tailored in gaining feedback. Founded: 2020 in Bengaluru, India. Team: What they\u2019re building: A UPI-based payments service that provides a pay later option to college students. The company says it uses alternative credit scoring models to get credit to a wider audience. Key quote: \u201c More than 150 million people in India are not able to access formal credits in India either because of lack of financial data or low credit scores,\u201d the company said on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. \u201cWe use alternative credit scoring models to provide a Pay Later option on UPI to a wider audience.\u201d Our thoughts: Micro loan lending is a common way that we see accessibility and fintech companies overlap. In PayCrunch\u2019s case, it is relying on a unified payments interface, a system that can bring multiple bank accounts, fund routes and payments into one app. It claims it\u2019s the first company to bring this technology to students in India (which we can\u2019t verify) but again, it\u2019s easy to see a massive potential customer base with this one. Founded: 2021 in New Delhi, India. Team: What they\u2019re building: A way to record and modify APIs without developers needing to touch the back-end. It is available as a browser extension and a desktop app, and claims it is already in production with over 40,000 developers across over 500 organizations. Key quote: \u201cAs an Uber engineer, I\u2019d like to test what happens when driver allotment API fails, is there an automatic retry or do we ask the user to retry, or does the app crash,\u201d the company said on Y Combinator\u2019s blog post. Our thoughts: API startups have exploded (and thus fragmented) over the past few years. Requestly is smart to try to bring some sort of unification, and ease, to managing those different tools from a higher level. Founded: 2019 in New Delhi, India Team: What they\u2019re building: A suite of services for mobile-first businesses, specifically focused on managing documents via smartphones. The company says it has 3 million monthly active users over the last 18 months and grows that number at 10% per month. It has 2,000 paying customers to date. Key quote: \u201cWith over 200M such businesses in India, at $15/year subscription price, this a $3B opportunity in India & much larger globally,\u201d the company wrote on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. Our thoughts: Document scanning and cloud storage feels like a niche solution, so it will be interesting see how Kaagaz expands from here. A strength, presumably, is definitely ease of use, given that you can modify documents from your phone. Founded: 2021 in Hyderabad, India. Team: What they\u2019re building: An operating system for Indian classrooms. Edustack helps teachers assign digitized worksheets, and also send reminders, evaluate, and track engagement of those assignments. It\u2019s free for teachers to use, and sells its platform \u2013 which includes customized worksheets and a consultant \u2013 to schools. Key quote: \u201cEdustack saves 1000\u2019s of hours for teachers by helping them to assign digitized worksheets, send reminders, automate evaluation and instantaneously generate analytics. Digital worksheets are our wedge,\u201d the company wrote on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. Our thoughts: Interactive worksheets can\u2019t be where Edustack stops \u2014 after all, stack is in its name. We\u2019re interested in seeing how Edustack builds more proactive and student-centered services into its platform, which smartly wants to digitize the antiquated paper-and-pen style school day. Testing and tutoring would be easy pivots, but, heck, surprise us! Founded: 2021 in Gurugram, India. Team: What they\u2019re building: Self-described as a \u201cnext generation social dialer app,\u201d Tingo lets people set video ringtones for friends and family. While that may sound niche, its vision is much broader (and expands beyond India). Tingo wants to give users a whole new caller experience and app to use to connect with their close friends Key quote: \u201cEvery day over 40K people use Tingo to set video ringtones for their friends and family. We are growing at 17% weekly and [have] handled 25M+ phone calls through the app in the last 2 month,\u201d the company wrote on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. Our thoughts: The moonshot of the company is that it can convince India, and eventually the world, to use a new app when trying to get in touch with friends. It\u2019s a social media play built atop short-form video, a form factor that we\u2019ve already seen proven out with the rise of TikTok (which, obviously, continues to be a dominant force and could prove hard to topple). Image Credits: Bryce Durbin Founded: 2021 in Mumbai, India Team size: 11 Founders : What they\u2019re building : An employee healthcare platform for companies in India enables employees to access unlimited health consultation and traditional hospital expenses. Key quote: \u201cEmployers provide health insurance, but it is insufficient for most, we also offer an easy way for employees to expand their coverage,\u201d the company wrote on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. Our thoughts: The Covid pandemic has spurred the need for greater access to a comprehensive healthcare benefit than only traditional hospital expenses. InsureMyTeam says it posted $16,000 in revenue and grew at 38% month-over-month over the past 5 months. The founders\u2019 experience in insurance, healthcare, and fintech sectors could prove helpful to operate the insurtech startup. Founded: 2020 in Bengaluru, India Team size: 14 Founders : \u00b7 Udita Pal, an early team member of Opentalk, Tapchief and Manch, worked with more than 35 startups across the global as a consultant \u00b7 Ankit Parasher, an IIT Kharagpur graduate and a former co-founder of logistics platform LetsTransport, founded SALT. What they\u2019re building : A platform that provides cross-border payments and compliance for small and medium-size businesses. The company offers banking, document management and workflow automation to companies that handle international transactions. SALT has raised a $500,000 seed round last October, as per Times of India . Key quote: \u201cSALT is a neo banking solution stitched together to ease payments and documentation which comes with business banking by moving it to a digital-first and automated end to end platform,\u201d the company wrote on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. Our thoughts: As India\u2019s exports hit the $400 billion mark for the first time for fiscal year of 2022, more robust cross-border banking and compliance service providers for businesses will be needed. SALT could be one of the companies that make the international transaction easier. Founded: 2021 in Bengaluru, India Team size: 10 Founders : What they\u2019re building : RecordBook, a mobile and SaaS-based application, enables small and medium corporations to digitize all business data and workflows. Key quote: \u201cRecordBook is one stop solution to manage all business data, workflows and teams for small and medium businesses on their mobile devices and in their local languages,\u201d the company wrote on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. Founded: 2020 in Bengaluru, India Team size: 6 Founders : \u00b7 Mehul Jindal is co-founder and CEO at BharatX. Four undergraduate students at the National Institute of Technology Tiruchy founded BharaX. \u00b7 Shyam Murugan is co-founder of BharatX. \u00b7 Eeshan Sharma is co-founder and COO of BharatX. \u00b7 Siddharth Venu, co-founder of BharatX, says he loves building tech and watching anime. What they\u2019re building : The company enables low-income persons in India to get credit via consumer-facing apps. BharatX has raised a $250k pre-seed round last year, per mint. Key quote: \u201cWe operate our Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) in a white-labelled manner on other apps and websites,\u201d the company said on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. Our thoughts: This fintech startup wants to capture a niche market the banks couldn\u2019t provide\u2013 access to credit to every lower-income Indian with a zero-document flow. BharatX keeps expanding its service to pay later for food delivery and ride-hailing apps. Founded: 2020 in Pune, India Team size: 9 Founders : What they\u2019re building : The company is building an AI SaaS platform that offers web-based medical annotation tools for 2D and 3D data. RedBrick AI\u2019s tool, which automates up to 80% of iterative manual labeling, enables easy work for its customers and external labelers. Medical image annotation is the process of labeling medical imaging data, including X-Ray, CT, MRI scans, or ultrasound. Key quote: \u201cThe RedBrick configurable workflow system helps teams build robust and scalable quality assurance processes. RedBrick AI offers a suite of APIs to help developers consume the annotations being created, and integrate with MLOps,\u201d the company wrote on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. Our thoughts: Artificial intelligence (AI) can analyze a large amount of data in images stored by healthcare organizations. Health professionals will be able to save time, make better-informed decisions, and avoid potential errors through Redbrick AI\u2019s tool. Founded: 2020 in Bengaluru, India Team size: 7 Founders : \u00b7 Shiv Bidani, co-founder of Streak, worked at PwC India prior to founding Streak. \u00b7 Balaji R, co-founder of Streak, says he\u2019s \u201ca hard-core engineer with experience in disturbed systems and databases.\u201d \u00b7 Mitul Mehta, former CEO of BoxMyLook, a subscription-based fashion service, co-founded Streak. He also worked at CRED. What they\u2019re building : A neo-banking platform for children in India. It provides a pre-paid card linked to its app with unique safety controls. The users can transact using the Streak card and earn coins for rewards. Key quote: \u201cAt Streak, we are building a new age personalized & gamified banking solution for teenagers,\u201d the company wrote on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. Our thoughts: This startup sounds like another edu-fintech startup for teens in the batch (see Yodaa at the very bottom) to help young adults save money and get smart with money. Founded: 2021 in Bengaluru, India Team size: 10 Founders : What they\u2019re building : The company is building a reverse ETL platform that synchronizes data from customers\u2019 cloud data warehouses to business apps like Salesforce, Hubspot and Google Ads.

The company says it has built more than 300 stores in the past 9 months for brands like Bridgestone, Westside, Oyo, and Chai point using its AI-powered project planning software and a managed marketplace of contractors in India. Key quote: \u201cIndia is massively building its retail infra in Tier2/3 towns,\u201d co-founder and CEO Amit Bansal told The Economic Times. \u201cFrom conceptualization to completion, we offer brands hassle-free turnkey retail fit-out solutions.\u201d Our thoughts: 91Squarefeet claims it is growing more than 20% month-on-month despite the covid pandemic that accelerates consumers\u2019 shift to online channels. According to The Economic Times, retailers and quick-service restaurant chains opened four new stores in India almost every day last year. With Covid restrictions easing in India, it is expected that more companies might have plans to open their offline offices and use 91Squarefeet\u2019s platform. Founded: 2021 in Bengaluru, India Team size: 10 Founders : What they\u2019re building : Shopr.tv, a live commerce platform, is Twitch for fashion and beauty, where creators can broadcast, build an audience, and monetize by selling over live streams. The startup says it has a strong partner pipeline, with over 70 creators and 12 brands whose products these creators can sell. Key quote: \u201c We are Twitch for Fashion and Beauty, where creators can broadcast, build an audience, and monetize by selling over live streams,\u201d the company wrote on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. Our thoughts: The experienced co-founders are targeting a huge market, one that brings together live-streaming, e-commerce, and social networking. Shopr.tv claims that the slice of the beauty and fashion industry that it\u2019s targeting is valued at $24 billion (which seems low, actually), and has 150 million consumers. Meanwhile, the young startup plans to make money by taking a 10-12% cut on every sale.

Key quote: \u201cYou can imagine this as Siri/Alexa for learning and practicing English speaking,\u201d the company wrote on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. Our thoughts: NinjaStudy says it enables non-native English speakers to learn and practice English. They can use the app as if they are talking to Alex or Siri; an AI tutor will then correct users\u2019 grammar, pronunciation, etc. Based on its website, NinjaStudy seems still to be working on its beta app, which is aimed at adults. When it\u2019s out, we\u2019d like to see whether it indeed offers unique features compared with its peers. Founded: 2021 in Mumbai, India Team size: 11 Founders : \u00b7 Parth Garg, co-founder and co-CEO at Vance, had dropped out of Stanford University to found startups. \u00b7 John Finkelman, co-founder and co-CEO of Vance, also dropped out of Stanford to found Vence in January 2022.

Key quote: \u201cAt Janani, we got to the root cause of the problem through our proprietary diagnostic and treatment plans created with the help of expert doctors,\u201d Nilay Mehrotra co-founder said in an interview with The Economic Times . Our thoughts: Janani, which launched four months ago starting with at-home semen diagnostic, already generates about $8,000 revenue per month, growing 50% every month, the company wrote on Y Combinator\u2019s blog. Janani makes $60 per customer, targeting 130 million infertile Indians. The global fertility treatment market is expected to reach $21.7 billion in 2025 from $15.74 billion in 2021.

            "full_description": "(Bloomberg) -- (Bloomberg) -- The energy transition has become a weapon . That\u2019s one consequence of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. If war is a force that gives us meaning, this one is redefining the global energy system. What had until recently been Europe\u2019s decades-long pursuit of a green agenda to replace coal and natural gas with wind turbines and batteries has become a matter of wartime urgency. Leaders in Brussels, Berlin, Paris, and Warsaw woke up to a new reality in which spending up to $1 billion per day on Russian fossil fuels meant financing the missiles exploding in Kyiv. So the transition accelerates. Efforts to fight climate change often adopt the language of war. It\u2019s aspirational, in a dark way. Scientific warnings and extreme weather haven\u2019t yet spurred the global economy to fully mobilize against greenhouse gas. So those who want more urgency resort to combat metaphors. Now an actual war might turn, in part, on curbing or even embargoing one of the biggest sources of fossil fuels. Clean energy isn\u2019t waiting for a geopolitical shift. The world stands on the verge of installing its one-thousandth gigawatt of solar electricity . The road to that milestone \u2014 the first solar terawatt \u2014 started with the invention of primitive panels in the 1950s. The second terawatt will come in less than four years, according to BloombergNEF. It\u2019s possible that India, with a new net-zero goal , will play a China-size role in the next stage. The growing markets for renewables haven\u2019t escaped the inequities that shape the fossil economy. Microfinance businesses bringing solar rigs to rural Africa end up turning off the lights on villagers and refugees when the payments stop, and mircogrids already built in Indonesia are shutting off for lack of funding . The planet\u2019s cheapest energy source is, somehow, still unaffordable for those who need it most. Welcome to the sixth issue of Bloomberg Green \u2019s magazine. Stories from the latest issue will continue rolling out until early April, and everything we\u2019ve published will be available on this collection page . The only magazine focused on climate and the energy transition is sent to our all-access subscribers, so sign up today to receive a print edition along with full digital access to Bloomberg Green . Here are some of the highlights so far\u2026 Meet the new Arctic scientists . Inuit groups are reshaping climate research with local knowledge from living with ice. The rich are different . They account for far more emissions, regardless of the wealth of the nation where they live \u2014 and we have the data to prove it. What happens when London\u2019s housing crisis meets its flood-prone future? These maps show the areas at risk. The giant rock statues of Easter Island that have survived from antiquity face an uncertain future due to climate change. This green building is flunking New York\u2019s climate law. And one of Manhattan\u2019s real estate powerhouses isn\u2019t happy about it. Dam builders around the world are pushing into high-risk areas , often based on outdated climate data. The confessions of a carbon seller who made millions on faulty offsets and now wants to fix a broken system . Kim Stanley Robinson\u2019s plan to save the Doomsday Glacier: send the navy and the oil industry to Antarctica . The world\u2019s greenest insurance giant faces the choice of burning its clients or burning more carbon. The bankers who lend billions to the oil and gas industry aren\u2019t feeling the pinch of net-zero just yet . \u00a92022 Bloomberg L.P.",

            "full_description": "Greenpeace, Cryptocurrency billionaire lobby to change Bitcoin code. Bitcoin is about to face a fresh onslaught over its damaging environmental footprint. Several climate change activist groups including Greenpeace and crypto billionaire Chris Larsen are launching a \u201cChange the Code, Not the Climate\u201d campaign, designed to pressure the Bitcoin community to alter the way it orders transactions that already consumes as much power as Sweden. In five years Bitcoin may consume as much power as Japan, Larsen said in an interview. The campaign will buy ads in leading publications over the next month. Greenpeace, Environmental Working Group and some local activist groups battling Bitcoin miners are also mobilizing their millions of members for grassroots efforts. The campaign has already reached out to a dozen key people and corporations, some of them involved in Bitcoin and yet pledging Environmental, Social and Governance, or ESG, compliance, according to Michael Brune, who is in charge of the campaign. \u201cWe are in this campaign for the long haul, but we are hoping -- particularly since Bitcoin is now being financed by entities and individuals who care about climate change -- that we can compel leadership to agree that this is a problem that needs to be addressed,\u201d said Brune, who was a long-time executive director of the Sierra Club before resigning last year. \u201cGoldman Sachs, BlackRock, PayPal, Venmo, Fidelity -- there are lots of companies we anticipate will be helpful to this effort.\u201d The campaign is counting on several factors to help its cause: There\u2019s increasing frustration in some communities in the U.S. that have found themselves hosting Bitcoin miners and dealing with issues such as excessive noise. After China banned crypto mining last year, a flood of miners moved to the U.S. Bitcoin\u2019s main rival, Ethereum, is readying for a major software overhaul that will make it more environmentally friendly. Just like Bitcoin, it\u2019s currently using giant server farms to order transactions via a process called Proof of Work. But within months Ethereum could switch to a different method, called Proof of Stake, which is projected by some to cut its energy consumption by 99%. \u201cNow with Ethereum changing, Bitcoin really is the outlier,\u201d Larsen said. \u201cSome of the newer protocols -- Solana, Cardano -- are built on low energy.\u201d Larsen said he\u2019s put in $5 million to fund the campaign, partly because he feels that Bitcoin won\u2019t continue to enjoy investors\u2019 support unless it changes. \u201cI want to see Bitcoin and Ethereum succeed,\u201d said Larsen, who owns some Bitcoin and Ether, as well as XRP. Last year, Larsen had a net worth of $3.4 billion, according to Forbes\u2019 billionaires list. He is executive chairman and co-founder of Ripple, which supports XRP. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Ripple, Larsen and another executive in 2020, alleging they \u201craised over $1.3 billion through an unregistered, ongoing digital asset securities offering.\u201d The case is expected to wrap up this year. Larsen said he is not launching this campaign to bring down a rival cryptocurrency. \u201cIf I was concerned about Bitcoin as a competitor, probably the best thing I could do is let it continue on this path,\u201d Larsen said. \u201cThis is just an unsustainable path.\u201d In recent years, Larsen said he has refocused on philanthropy, and invested about $90 million into various causes, many of them related to climate change. Bitcoin\u2019s environmental concerns came to the fore last year, when Elon Musk said Tesla Inc. would resume accepting Bitcoin as payment only after at least 50% of the mining relies on renewable energy. Larsen said Bitcoin\u2019s power consumption issue could be fixed via a soft or a hard fork -- both changing the network\u2019s code to make Bitcoin less power hungry. A soft fork would preserve Bitcoin as a single blockchain. A hard fork would split Bitcoin into two separate networks, one supporting miners and the other running different code -- perhaps Proof of Stake. The campaign believes that about 50 key miners, crypto exchanges and core developers have the power to change Bitcoin\u2019s code. Whether the campaign will work is a different story. Bitcoin miners -- earning more than $15 billion last year, according to data from The Block Research -- would have to be given incentives to switch. Shifting to Proof of Stake is technologically complex, and it has taken Ethereum years to develop and to test the code necessary for the change. Perhaps more importantly, many Bitcoin diehards are adamant against changing the system created by Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous person or group credited with developing the software. \u201cI\u2019d put the chance of Bitcoin ever moving to PoS at exactly 0%,\u201d said Chris Bendiksen, a Bitcoin researcher at CoinShares and one of the world\u2019s leading experts on Bitcoin mining. \u201cThere is no appetite among Bitcoiners to destroy the security of the protocol by making such a move.\u201d But while maximalist Bitcoiners may not want to deviate from Nakamoto\u2019s vision, Larsen contends times are changing. \u201cSome of it borders on religion. Heresy, of course, is not a technological term,\u201d he said. \u201cNow a lot of what\u2019s driving crypto is the enormous liquidity that\u2019s come from the traditional market players. And generally those people are not religious about these technologies. So it\u2019s just a matter of time.\u201d",

Trudeau delivered the keynote address at a North American climate conference in Vancouver Tuesday, just moments after the government\u2019s new climate strategy was tabled in Ottawa. He also addressed the ongoing Russia-Ukraine crisis which has entered its 34th day with some concessions announced in talks by Russia. The prime minister is set to meet with B.C. Premier John Horgan after an announcement with Environment and Climate Change Minister Steven Guilbeault and Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson. Tuesday afternoon, he will meet with local students to again speak about the environment. That event will also see Vancouver South Liberal MP Harjit S. Sajjan in attendance. Sajjan, former Defence Minister, has been put in charge of two ministries since a cabinet shuffle and is responsible for Pacific Economic Development and International Development.

But rather than simply complain, she and a group of other young people are taking on who they see as the enablers of this pollution: government officials who continue to green-light fossil fuel development. Earlier this month, seven young activists filed a lawsuit against the state of Utah with the help of Our Children\u2019s Trust, a nonprofit law firm that focuses on climate justice. Natalie R. v. State of Utah alleges that the state and its elected officials unconstitutionally favour fossil fuel companies at the expense of residents\u2019 rights to a healthy and safe life.

They need relief today,\u201d Welle said. I spoke with Natalie, a high school student in Salt Lake City, about the lawsuit and what drove her to activism. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity. Angely Mercado, Earther: How did you become involved in filing this lawsuit? Natalie: I\u2019m an activist with an organisation here in Utah called Fridays for Future Utah, and so I had been planning a couple of climate strikes. I hadn\u2019t heard of Our Children\u2019s Trust up until Earth Day last year, when I was presenting with Sierra Club. I wondered if there was a Utah movement, because I heard of lawsuits occurring in [other] states. Then we started an interview process to figure out how we would pursue this lawsuit, and since then six other people have joined. Since my complaint is the first listed, it just happens to be my name, but we\u2019re all equally part of it. Earther: Why take legal action, as opposed to organising another climate strike or finding other ways to push Utah\u2019s elected officials? window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_1_hpu-mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); Natalie: It\u2019s different from just doing a regular strike, because we can take legal action in this case. And if the court decides that our constitutional rights are being violated, then we can get legal change. We live in a society where most change is made through the government. I would encourage people to look at how their legal rights and liberties are violated through their government\u2019s actions and how they\u2019re being impacted by climate change. When people can see what their governments are doing that is violating their rights as citizens \u2014 that\u2019s pretty powerful to help them take action. Earther: You feel that the state has not protected your constitutional rights. Can you explain that more? Natalie: Utah has many laws in place that support the fossil fuel industry and allow for permitting for exploration, extraction, and exportation of fossil fuels and also for them to be combusted in the state, which is causing significant problems with our air quality. Personally, I\u2019m a very active person and I like to go outside, so [it\u2019s about our rights] to be able to be outside and lead a physically active lifestyle and a healthy lifestyle, as well as mental health when being outdoors. Sometimes I\u2019m not able to go outside, because the air quality is deemed toxic and harmful. That\u2019s a violation of my rights, because I should be able to go outside. This happens quite a bit, especially over the past two years. We\u2019ve had very bad air quality going into Salt Lake. And then we\u2019ve also experienced heat warnings. Earther: How does it feel to sue your state government? window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_2_mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); Natalie: It does feel a little weird, but with the support of everybody, with all the plaintiffs and with [attorneys] Andrew and Amira, it doesn\u2019t feel like that daunting of a task. There\u2019s a bunch of youth, ages nine to 18, suing their government, and that\u2019s not something you hear about every day. Earther: How have people you know reacted to the news? Natalie: There\u2019s not too many reactions at the moment, but I think if we get a court day, and once we get more publicity on this, hopefully, there\u2019ll be more support from students my age\u2026 that\u2019s what I\u2019ve hoped for. Earther: What do you most want the public to understand about this lawsuit? Natalie: It\u2019s not that the state isn\u2019t doing enough to combat climate change. It\u2019s that they\u2019re actively contributing to it through the laws that they\u2019ve enacted. And so while they are, in a sense, not doing enough, they are also actively contributing. A win in this case would reduce emissions, help improve the air quality, and in general provide a better climate.

Earther : What do you most want the public to understand about this lawsuit? Natalie : It\u2019s not that the state isn\u2019t doing enough to combat climate change. It\u2019s that they\u2019re actively contributing to it through the laws that they\u2019ve enacted. And so while they are, in a sense, not doing enough, they are also actively contributing. A win in this case would reduce emissions, help improve the air quality, and in general provide a better climate.",

(Shutterstock)Plastic pollution is a global problem, contaminating terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems. Microplastics \u2014 plastic particles smaller than five millimetres in size \u2014 infiltrate and circulate in the global planetary dust cycle, water cycle and carbon cycle. Microplastics have infiltrated the food and water we consume and the air we breathe. These tiny plastic particles can harm wildlife populations and communities, threatening the ecological balance. A new paper suggests plastics are a planetary boundary threat and that we are outside the safe operating space. In early March, after years of negotiations, delegates from 175 nations committed to draft the first global treaty on plastic pollution at the UN Environment Assembly in Nairobi. This resolution comes 30 years after the creation of the first global treaty to address climate change in 1992, which recognized there was a problem with greenhouse gases but did not include quantitative global targets until the Kyoto Protocol in 2005. As researchers studying plastic pollution and working at the science-policy interface, we believe there is enough evidence regarding contamination and the effects of plastic pollution to see that the first treaty on plastic needs to include quantitative targets and binding measures that facilitate a circular economy \u2014 a system that focuses on reusing and reducing plastic waste. No time to waste As with climate change, the urgency to find a solution to plastic pollution is clear. Trends show an increasing trajectory for plastic emissions \u2014 plastic emitted into the environment \u2014 just as they do for greenhouse gas emissions. In 2021, we estimated that around 30 million tonnes of plastic waste was emitted into freshwater and marine ecosystems. If we continue business as usual, that number could increase more than two-fold by the end of this decade. In 2017, we called for a global treaty to facilitate collaboration on this global issue, and in 2020 a systemic shift in the plastics economy \u2014 bending our current linear plastic economy (make-take-waste) into a circular economy (make-take-reuse), fundamentally changing the way we use plastic materials to minimize waste. A giant art sculpture showing a tap outpouring plastic bottles was erected outside the UN Environment Program headquarters in Nairobi, on March 2, 2022, during the UN Environment Assembly where delegates met to discuss a binding international framework to address the growing problem of plastic waste in the world\u2019s oceans, rivers and landscapes. (AP Photo/Brian Inganga) Our vision of an effective treaty A global treaty on plastic must have a circular economy at its core. It should also set global targets for reducing plastic emissions akin to the Paris Agreement for carbon emissions. To facilitate success, the treaty should include global mechanisms that incentivize a circular economy, methods for reporting plastic emissions at the local and national level and resources that aid economies in measuring and reducing these emissions. To measurably reduce plastic emissions, we envision a global treaty where countries sign on as signatories with a defined reduction target. For example, each country might agree to reduce 40 per cent of its emissions by 2030 from base-year levels. To facilitate a circular economy, there needs to be a global cap on virgin plastic production, recycled content standards or a shift from incentives for virgin plastic to incentives for post-consumer recycled plastic. When it comes to dealing with plastic waste, we need to switch our make-take-waste approach for a make-take-reuse one. Each country needs to come up with a strategy to meet reduction targets. Because there is no one-size-fits-all solution, each country may take on its own set of unique solutions to reach its target. For example, countries may adopt container deposit schemes to increase recycling rates, eliminate the use of single-use plastic items like plastic bags and straws that are not essential and do not fit into a circular economy, improve waste collection and management infrastructure, and agree to market only plastics that are either recyclable or reusable in their region, if not both. Each year countries must report their plastic emissions to a body like the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as part of this treaty. Determining baseline emissions, setting reduction targets and tracking our progress towards meeting those targets require formal accounting. Regular reporting of plastic emissions to the UNFCCC as part of this new treaty could help countries set reduction targets and track their progress towards meeting those targets. (Shutterstock) Here, another tool we can borrow from climate policy is the emissions inventory, which accounts for the total amount of emissions that originates from relevant sources within cities, provinces, states or countries. Emissions inventories help prioritize the reduction of emissions from the largest sources within a given region and are necessary to accurately check the effectiveness of solutions. Emissions inventories will quantify progress, identify leaders and laggards and document the success of our transition to a circular economy. For some countries, aid will be necessary to build new infrastructure for reducing plastic pollution. These countries need access to a global fund, similar to the UNFCCC\u2019s climate fund. To build this fund, an extended producer responsibility program \u2014 a materials management program funded by those who make plastics \u2014 can be implemented. For example, if a fund pulled in $0.01 for every pound of virgin plastic produced, it would have equated to $8 billion per year in 2020. Let\u2019s get to work For plastic pollution, the phrase \u201cthere is no time to waste\u201d is not just clever, it is spot on. As we negotiate how we will end plastic pollution, the problem continues to grow. We cannot wait another decade to establish baselines, reduction targets and thresholds for the safety of our environment and human health. We are optimistic about the recent resolution to draft a global treaty on plastic pollution and thrilled that Canada aims to be a leader in its creation and actions necessary to make positive change. International governments have provided an opportunity for systemic change, so let us make the most of it and develop a global treaty with quantitative targets and binding resolutions that measurably reduce our production of plastic waste and pollution.

Other cryptocurrencies use just a fraction of the energy Bitcoin requires because they use a different system to verify transactions. \u201cChange the code, not the climate\u201d In order to validate transactions, Bitcoin miners rely on specialized hardware to solve complex puzzles.

The new campaign aims to move Bitcoin away from that energy-hungry proof of work process. The most popular alternative is called proof of stake.

            "content": "MICHELE CATTANI/AFP via Getty ImagesThe ancient Timbuktu manuscripts of Mali were back in the headlines following internet giant Google\u2019s initiative to host a collection of them at an online gallery. The images of the documents, text in Arabic, can be found at a page called Mali Magic. No place in West Africa has attracted more attention and resources than the city that has always captivated the imagination of the outside world, Timbuktu. There have been documentaries and books, academic studies and a renewed public interest since some of Timbuktu\u2019s world heritage status buildings were damaged in attacks in 2012. The manuscripts, themselves, some reputed to date as early as the 1400s, were threatened and the international community responded. While Mali Magic displays 45 very photogenic manuscripts from one private library, the site doesn\u2019t begin to tell the full story of the wealth of West Africa\u2019s manuscripts that are found from the Atlantic to Lake Chad. But thanks to decades of scholarship and, recently, digitisation, that information is now accessible at a bilingual, open-access, online union catalogue of nearly 80,000 manuscripts at the West African Arabic Manuscript Database. This is a resource I began 30 years ago at the University of Illinois that now provides students access to most of the titles and authors that make up West Africa\u2019s manuscript culture. It\u2019s at this website that one can access the archive of an association of 35 private Timbuktu manuscript libraries \u2013 called SAVAMA-DCI. The association has been working with universities on three continents to secure and record, now digitally, their Arabic and Arabic-script manuscripts. Read more: Timbuktu destruction: landmark ruling awards millions to Malians The West African Arabic Manuscript Database provides an even bigger picture. It is a comprehensive inventory of over 100 public and private West African manuscript libraries. In it, we find one-third of all extant manuscripts with known authors (314 titles), written by 204 scholars, one-quarter of them from West Africa. Most of these manuscripts come from the 1800s, but have very deep historical roots. The full story of West Africa\u2019s manuscript culture and Islamic learning centres will finally be known when the attention that is lavished on Timbuktu\u2019s manuscripts is also given to libraries in neighbouring Mauritania, Niger and Nigeria. But we already know a good deal. Centres of learning Earliest contact between North Africa and Timbuktu focused on West Africa\u2019s gold trade. This commerce also brought Islamic teachings across the Sahara Desert. The first reference to manuscripts in Timbuktu was in the 1400s, contributing to the mystique that has always enveloped the city as a centre of Islamic education. In fact, Timbuktu was only one of several southern Saharan towns that attracted scholars and offered Islamic learning. In the 1500s, what is called Timbuktu\u2019s \u2018Golden Age\u2019, its famous scholars were known across North Africa. That period waned, but Arabic learning revived again in the 1800s across West Africa in the wake of several Islamic reform movements that stretched from today\u2019s Guinea and the Senegal River Valley to Northern Nigeria. Today\u2019s older manuscripts in West Africa mainly date from this period. With the decline of scholarship in Timbuktu in the 1600s, Islamic learning emerged in nomadic centres to the west (in today\u2019s Mauritania). There\u2019s also a national collection of manuscripts in Mauritania that is based on the contents of 80-odd private libraries. They give us a good idea of what was traditionally found in manuscript libraries. What\u2019s in West Africa\u2019s manuscripts? The exact subject matter in each of the categories would vary somewhat from one library to the next. But the dominant subject \u2013 legal writing \u2013 tended to account for one-quarter to one-third of all the manuscripts. West Africa\u2019s manuscript culture evolved, for the most part, outside any state system. In the absence of a central authority, juridical matters were dispensed by local legal scholars who could cite precedent, case law, to resolve thorny problems.

The ratios of manuscripts dealing with mysticism (Sufism); the Qur\u2019an (including copies of the Holy Book) especially recitation styles; Arabic language (lexicology, syntax, prosody, pre-Islamic poetry); and theology vary, each subject accounting for 7% to 13% of the manuscripts in most libraries.

Oddly, the subject of history, like geography, is almost entirely ignored in many collections. This reminds us, that Arabic and by extension, Arabic script was at base a religious language used for religious purposes, and its use for secular subjects was not common. The power of the Arabic alphabet More significant than these Islamic sciences, or disciplines, are the uses to which the Arabic alphabet was applied across West Africa. Arabic uses a phonetic alphabet; each letter always produces the same sound. What this means is that the Arabic script can be used to write any language. To explain the Arabic of the Qur\u2019an, teachers frequently translated key words into the students\u2019 African language (written in Arabic script). Many West African manuscripts that were used in teaching show these interlineal insertions. From this practice it was an easy step to write classic legends, or memory aids, or poetry in African languages \u2013 all in Arabic script. The name this writing is given in Arabic is \u201c`ajam\u012b\u201d (writing in a foreign language). These manuscripts make up about 15% of most collections in West Africa today.

The images of the documents, text in Arabic, can be found at a page called Mali Magic . No place in West Africa has attracted more attention and resources than the city that has always captivated the imagination of the outside world, Timbuktu. There have been documentaries and books, academic studies and a renewed public interest since some of Timbuktu\u2019s world heritage status buildings were damaged in attacks in 2012. The manuscripts, themselves, some reputed to date as early as the 1400s, were threatened and the international community responded. While Mali Magic displays 45 very photogenic manuscripts from one private library, the site doesn\u2019t begin to tell the full story of the wealth of West Africa\u2019s manuscripts that are found from the Atlantic to Lake Chad. But thanks to decades of scholarship and, recently, digitisation, that information is now accessible at a bilingual, open-access, online union catalogue of nearly 80,000 manuscripts at the West African Arabic Manuscript Database . This is a resource I began 30 years ago at the University of Illinois that now provides students access to most of the titles and authors that make up West Africa\u2019s manuscript culture. It\u2019s at this website that one can access the archive of an association of 35 private Timbuktu manuscript libraries \u2013 called SAVAMA-DCI . The association has been working with universities on three continents to secure and record, now digitally, their Arabic and Arabic-script manuscripts.

It is a comprehensive inventory of over 100 public and private West African manuscript libraries. In it, we find one-third of all extant manuscripts with known authors (314 titles), written by 204 scholars, one-quarter of them from West Africa. Most of these manuscripts come from the 1800s, but have very deep historical roots. The full story of West Africa\u2019s manuscript culture and Islamic learning centres will finally be known when the attention that is lavished on Timbuktu\u2019s manuscripts is also given to libraries in neighbouring Mauritania, Niger and Nigeria. But we already know a good deal. Earliest contact between North Africa and Timbuktu focused on West Africa\u2019s gold trade. This commerce also brought Islamic teachings across the Sahara Desert. The first reference to manuscripts in Timbuktu was in the 1400s, contributing to the mystique that has always enveloped the city as a centre of Islamic education. In fact, Timbuktu was only one of several southern Saharan towns that attracted scholars and offered Islamic learning.

The season 3 finale of Netflix\u2019s Snowpiercer has just landed, with Melanie Cavill (Jennifer Connelly) back in charge of the train, an abandoned mission to discover \u2018New Eden\u2019, and the big question of whether those on board will ever return to live on land. Perhaps just a warning of climate change, or maybe an allegory on social inequality, the series (along with the movie adaption from a French graphic novel series) follows 3000 survivors on board a train journeying rotations around a very icy world. The so-called \u2018Freeze\u2019 leads to the world covered over in ice, few remaining survivors, and a quest to keep those remaining alive on board an isolated train society. In the very first opening episode, we\u2019re introduced to the disastrous world that\u2019s been created as a failed attempt to solve global warming problems. Future leader of the train\u2019s society, Andre Layton (Daveed Diggs) explains: \u2018Our ice melted and all the species crashed. So the men of science tried to cool the earth, to reverse the damage they had sewn. \u2018But instead, they froze her to the core.\u2019 The only survivors left on Earth boarded \u2018The Great Ark train,\u2019 the only lasting route of survival. \u2018In the final days of The Freeze, the rich, many of them responsible, retreated to Snowpiercer, 1,001 cars long\u2026\u2019 The big freeze was a failed attempt to solve global warming (Picture: RUBA/BACKGRID) But how exactly did the world end up like that? And, as we near a global climate emergency, are we taking steps closer to becoming citizens of Snowpiercer? Snowpiercer\u2019s deep freeze follows geoengineering, which involves trying to counteract global warming by injecting particles into the stratosphere to block the sun\u2019s energy and cool the Earth. Although, as we see, this can go very, very wrong. According to Professor Duncan McLaren, a research fellow at Lancaster University, the situation of Snowpiercer is \u2018highly implausible,\u2019 despite being \u2018a useful allegory for what might happen in an extreme climate emergency of some form, whether that\u2019s through the continuation of climate change or some sort of problem trying to deal with it.\u2019 No one would have survived the icy world were it not for Mr Wilford\u2019s (Sean Bean) train (Picture: TNT) The show does however, to some extent, consider the dangers of geoengineering technologies and attempting to control global warming. Professor McLaren said: \u2018There are very genuine worries about whether we know [geoengineering technologies] well enough to control them properly, they could end up doing things we don\u2019t expect.\u2019 Dr Rob Bellamy, a presidential fellow in climate and society at the University of Manchester, added: \u2018These ideas are being considered by researchers mainly because of the fact that efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to tackle climate change are not doing so well and people are concerned that we might get to a point where we need to intervene in some other way in order to control the Earth\u2019s temperature.\u2019 Life outside the train is not as we know it\u2026 (Picture: Netflix) Whilst he agrees the situation of reaching a deep freeze state like in Snowpiercer \u2018very, very unlikely\u2019, he added that the series does highlight concerns about ongoing attempts to avoid climate change and the controversy surrounding research into geoengineering technologies. \u2018First of all, people are very wary of this idea, they\u2019re very wary of things that are seen to be tampering with nature,\u2019 Dr Bellamy added, highlighting other issues of geoengineering technologies like cost issues, and the effect on weather patterns. It\u2019s a fight for power not just a struggle to stay alive (Picture: Netflix) Power on board Snowpiercer isn\u2019t too different to real life (Picture: TNT/Netflix) While the academics therefore believe the show\u2019s link to reality is unlikely, the allegorical messages of Snowpiercer remain reflective of our real life society. Professor McLaren poignantly noted: \u2018We\u2019re never asked to question why does the train have to keep on going round and round and round, and in the world today we are never asked to question why we have to keep growing the economy bigger every time, even though it\u2019s causing climate change.\u2019 More: NetflixBridgerton: How old is John Bailey and does he have a boyfriend?Who does Anthony Bridgerton marry in Bridgerton season 2? Ending explainedWho was Carole Prentice as Bridgerton season 2 final episode pays tribute? So while the physical, climate aspects of Snowpiercer may not come true, (and there are too many social problems with suddenly placing 3000 people on a train and expecting them to form a cohesive, isolated society anyway) other aspects of of the science-fiction series remain relevant to real life, forcing us to question whether our actions are continuing to lead us to doom, and whether we\u2019re going into that blindly. Will geoengineering technologies leading to a deep freeze happen in our lifetimes? Probably not. Should it ever happen? Definitely no. Snowpiercer is available to watch on Netflix. Got a story?

And, as we near a global climate emergency, are we taking steps closer to becoming citizens of Snowpiercer? Snowpiercer\u2019s deep freeze follows geoengineering, which involves trying to counteract global warming by injecting particles into the stratosphere to block the sun\u2019s energy and cool the Earth. Although, as we see, this can go very, very wrong. According to Professor Duncan McLaren, a research fellow at Lancaster University, the situation of Snowpiercer is \u2018highly implausible,\u2019 despite being \u2018a useful allegory for what might happen in an extreme climate emergency of some form, whether that\u2019s through the continuation of climate change or some sort of problem trying to deal with it.\u2019 The show does however, to some extent, consider the dangers of geoengineering technologies and attempting to control global warming. Professor McLaren said: \u2018There are very genuine worries about whether we know [geoengineering technologies] well enough to control them properly, they could end up doing things we don\u2019t expect.\u2019 Dr Rob Bellamy, a presidential fellow in climate and society at the University of Manchester, added: \u2018These ideas are being considered by researchers mainly because of the fact that efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to tackle climate change are not doing so well and people are concerned that we might get to a point where we need to intervene in some other way in order to control the Earth\u2019s temperature.\u2019 Whilst he agrees the situation of reaching a deep freeze state like in Snowpiercer \u2018very, very unlikely\u2019, he added that the series does highlight concerns about ongoing attempts to avoid climate change and the controversy surrounding research into geoengineering technologies. \u2018First of all, people are very wary of this idea, they\u2019re very wary of things that are seen to be tampering with nature,\u2019 Dr Bellamy added, highlighting other issues of geoengineering technologies like cost issues, and the effect on weather patterns. While the academics therefore believe the show\u2019s link to reality is unlikely, the allegorical messages of Snowpiercer remain reflective of our real life society. Professor McLaren poignantly noted: \u2018We\u2019re never asked to question why does the train have to keep on going round and round and round, and in the world today we are never asked to question why we have to keep growing the economy bigger every time, even though it\u2019s causing climate change.\u2019 Bridgerton: How old is John Bailey and does he have a boyfriend? Who does Anthony Bridgerton marry in Bridgerton season 2? Ending explained Who was Carole Prentice as Bridgerton season 2 final episode pays tribute? So while the physical, climate aspects of Snowpiercer may not come true, (and there are too many social problems with suddenly placing 3000 people on a train and expecting them to form a cohesive, isolated society anyway) other aspects of of the science-fiction series remain relevant to real life, forcing us to question whether our actions are continuing to lead us to doom, and whether we\u2019re going into that blindly. Will geoengineering technologies leading to a deep freeze happen in our lifetimes? Probably not. Should it ever happen? Definitely no. Snowpiercer is available to watch on Netflix. Got a story?

            "full_description": "According to the latest assessment report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a considerable reduction in CO 2 emissions is required to limit the consequences of climate change. Producing fuel from renewable sources such as waste wood and straw or renewable electricity would be one way to reduce carbon emissions from the area of transportation. This is an area which is being addressed by researchers at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). Ethanol is usually produced through the fermentation of sugars from starchy raw materials such as corn, or from lignocellulosic biomass, such as wood or straw. It is an established fuel that decarbonizes the transportation sector and can be a building block to reduce emissions of CO 2 over the long term. In collaboration with the Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology (LUT) in Finland, researchers at the Straubing Campus for Biotechnology and Sustainability of the Technical University of Munich (TUM) have developed a new process for the production of ethanol. In this context, offcut materials from the area of forestry are used together with hydrogen. The hydrogen is produced by separating water into hydrogen and oxygen with the use of electricity\u2014in other words, with the use of water electrolysis. In the future, this will allow the excess electricity to be used for the production of ethanol. \"The overall process mainly consists of technically mature sub-processes. However, the composition of the process steps and the final step\u2014the hydrogenation of acetic acid to produce ethanol\u2014are new,\" explains Daniel Kl\u00fch, a doctoral student at the Professorship of Renewable Energy Systems at the TUM Straubing campus. The costs of ethanol with the new production method are competitive The researchers have also assessed the economic feasibility. \"The prices we have calculated are based on assumptions for raw materials and energy. We are not using any current market prices. The calculation basis of our prices for the components in the chemical system is the year 2020,\" explains Kl\u00fch. The lowest cost for ethanol in the modeling was 0.65 euros per liter, with biomass costs of 20 euros per megawatt hour, electricity costs of 45 euros per megawatt hour, and a production volume of approximately 42 kilotons of ethanol per year. \"With the current lignocellulosic ethanol production options, the costs are therefore competitive. The price of ethanol is very sensitive to the costs of electricity, and fluctuates between 0.56 and 0.74 euros per liter,\" explains Assistant Professor Kristian Melin of LUT in Finland. One reason for the high profitability is that the ethanol yield is much higher compared to traditional fermentation based bioethanol process from straw or wood. This process produces 1350 to 1410 liters of ethanol, compared to only 200 to 300 liters of ethanol for the traditional process per dry ton of biomass. Where production facilities could be located Part of the study is focusing on the variable geographical positioning of production sites, which would enable a degree of independence from suppliers to be achieved. \"Countries with a high potential for waste wood and green electricity , such as Finland or even Canada, can serve as producers of acetic acid, which, in the final process step, is hydrogenated to produce ethanol,\" explains Prof. Tuomas Koiranen of LUT. \"In the future, countries like Germany will hopefully have a green electricity mix and will be able to carry out the hydrogenation of acetic acid to ethanol at a domestic level. However, Germany does not have the waste wood potential for a large-scale biomass gasification which is required for the synthesis of acetic acid,\" adds Prof. Matthias Gaderer, Professor of Renewable Energy Systems at TUM. The technology needs to mature further With the use of green electricity to power the electrolysis, this process can produce a low CO 2 fuel that has a greenhouse gas reduction potential of 75% in comparison with a fossil fuel such as gasoline. Ethanol is established as a fuel. It can be used in the form of both E-10 gasoline, with 10% ethanol in the fuel mixture for regular automobiles, as is already the case, or as ED95, which is 95% ethanol , as a diesel substitute for heavy goods transportation. With their process simulation, the scientists have demonstrated the competitiveness of the process. \"To commercialize this product, it is necessary to further improve the degree of technological maturity. The next steps could entail further catalyst developments, a reactor design and the construction and operation of a pilot system,\" says Prof. Gaderer. Explore further",

            "full_description": "OTTAWA\u2014The federal government has unveiled its new road map to slash greenhouse gas emissions over the next decade, charting more than $9 billion in new spending on climate initiatives and a vision to reverse and drive down rising carbon pollution from Canada\u2019s oil and gas sector. Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault tabled the plan Tuesday morning in the House of Commons. The plan is a key requirement of the government\u2019s climate \u201caccountability\u201d law that is meant to ensure Canada breaks its losing streak and finally fulfils a promise to reduce greenhouse gas pollution that causes climate change. One significant part of that will be to reduce emissions from Canada\u2019s oil and gas sector, where emissions from extraction increased about 67 per cent between 2005 and 2019, according to the most recent federal data. The Liberals have promised to implement an emissions cap on the sector, and the new plan outlines how the government expects emissions from the oil and gas industry \u2014 responsible for more than a quarter of Canada\u2019s national emissions in 2019 \u2014 to drop 42 per cent below current levels by 2030. The plan also charts expected emissions reductions from buildings, transportation, heavy industry and electricity. To help drive these reductions, the plan includes extra money for federal climate programs, including $2.2 billion for the \u201cLow Carbon Economy Fund,\u201d which finances clean energy projects, $850 millions for clean electricity projects as Canada, and $780 million for projects that conserve wetlands and other natural features that store carbon. On zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs), the plan pledges another $400 million to build more charging stations, and $1.7 billion to extend the incentive program for people who buy these cars. The Canada Infrastructure Bank is also committing to spend $500 million on ZEV infrastructure, the plan says. The government will also require that at least 20 per cent of new light-duty vehicles sold in 2026 are ZEVs, a threshold that will increase to 60 per cent in 2030 and 100 per cent in 2035. Last year, the Liberal government ditched the climate target it inherited from Stephen Harper\u2019s Conservative administration \u2014 and committed to under the international Paris Agreement in 2015 \u2014 and replaced it with a more ambitious goal of slashing emissions to at least 40 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. But Canada is a long way from that target. The latest emissions data compiled by Environment Canada shows that greenhouse gas pollution only dropped by about one per cent from 2005 to 2019. Significant declines in emissions from electricity generation, thanks in large part to the government-enforced closure of coal-fired power plants, were offset over that time by marked increases in emissions from oil and gas extraction (67 per cent) and road transportation (14 per cent), the data shows. Tuesday\u2019s new plan is meant to finally drive down annual emissions toward the 2030 goal \u2014 and break Canada\u2019s sorry losing streak on its international climate commitments. This country has failed on every promise to slash emissions it has ever made, a dismal record that the federal environment commissioner bemoaned last year as he noted Canada\u2019s roughly one-per-cent increase in emissions since the Liberals took power in 2015 is the worst performance in the G7. The plan includes an \u201cinterim objective\u201d to slash emissions by at least 20 per cent below 2005 levels by 2026, and says that measures included in the plan are projected to cut emissions by 36 per cent in 2030, with measures still under development to be designed to help close the remaining gap to at least 40 per cent that year.

            "content": "Flickr/Irish Labour Party, CC BY-SARemember this name: Ivana Bacik. She is the new leader of Ireland\u2019s Labour party \u2013 and an energetic voice for change and social justice. Her paternal grandfather settled in Ireland from Czechoslovakia after the second world war after being imprisoned by the Nazis. Now in her early 50s, Bacik has been pushing for more progressive politics since she was a university student in the late 1980s. That was a time when Ireland was deeply conservative and recalcitrant, when promoting change was a dangerous game. In 1989, Bacik was taken to court and had faced the real prospect of prison for giving out information about abortion as a member of Trinity College Dublin\u2019s Student Union. It was nearly 30 years later, in 2018, that a referendum was passed that changed the constitution and made abortion legal in Ireland. Today Bacik still recalls how she never forgot women\u2019s voices at the end of the phone line looking for a phone number for a clinic in England. For Bacik, reproductive healthcare was not only a gender issue and a human rights issue but also, always, an economic issue. In this sense, Bacik has always championed intersectional feminism \u2013 the idea that women\u2019s lives are constructed by multiple, converging, overlapping systems of oppression. A barrister by training, Bacik has a fierce intellect and a sharp analytical mind. For many years she has taught criminal law, criminology and penology, as well as feminist theory and law at Trinity College Dublin. And yet she remains one of the most approachable, amicable politicians in Ireland today. Activism and energy There are two main aspects that make Bacik\u2019s political outlook distinctive in the Irish political landscape. Her activism and her non-confrontational style. While most politicians have a tendency to take positions motivated by what is more likely to win them votes, Bacik appears to prioritise her principles and integrity. And she looks as comfortable on the streets talking to ordinary people as she is in parliament debating with other elected politicians. Just like her contemporary Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the US, it is impossible to separate Bacik the politician from Bacik the activist. And just like 20th century Marxist Rosa Luxemburg, Bacik lives by the credo that the most revolutionary thing one can do is always to proclaim loudly what is happening. To be an activist requires passion, commitment and fearlessness, but also humility and generosity. Activism, in particular left-wing activism, is essentially egalitarian. Its anti-hierarchical premises are grounded on the principles of solidarity. Bacik\u2019s work reflects this, whether on abortion or same-sex marriages, working conditions for freelancers or secular marriage, the rights of immigrants and refugees or the emergency of climate change, the needs of children with additional needs or promoting equality for LGBT+ community. Interestingly, Bacik is currently chairperson of the Oireachtas (parliamentary) Committee on Gender Equality, working to promote a referendum in 2023 on the outdated and sexist language concerning women in the Irish constitution. Take Article 41.1 on the family, for example, which reads: the State recognises that by her life within the home, woman gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved. The State shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home. Inequality is a symptom of structural injustice so work to challenge and change basic social, cultural, economic and legal adages when they are shown to be outdated is vital. Bacik is also pushing for a universal childcare system, providing community-based support for all. Childcare provision is a major stumbling block towards a more equal, fair society. The prohibitive cost of childcare in Ireland is one reason why many more women in Ireland work in part-time jobs compared to men, a fact that contributes to other ramifications of gender inequality across society. The present childcare system is one of the most obvious and deplorable sources of structural injustice and inequality in Ireland today. Empathy and strength in leadership In my work, I have argued that social injustice is best understood in terms of three mutually reinforcing dimensions: maldistribution, exclusion, disempowerment. Those who are economically disadvantaged are also more likely to experience exclusion and, in turn, by being gradually disempowered, are less likely to stand up for their rights. That makes them less likely to become one of the few who benefit from the increasingly inequitable distribution of resources. As we emerge from a period of politics defined by vulgar and offensive language, simplistic slogans and the confrontational tone, Bacik\u2019s political style is refreshingly decent. She takes an accommodating approach to communication, prioritising listening and giving a voice to the voiceless and defending the cause of diversity and inclusion. In this respect, Bacik is not dissimilar from New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, who has always claimed that far from reflecting weakness, it takes strength to be an empathetic leader. The challenge facing all left-wing parties, in Ireland and around the world, is to win back the trust of the people they claim to represent \u2013 the least advantaged members of society, who feel marginalised and let down by democratic procedures. According to the most recent opinion poll support for Labour in Ireland now sits at 5%. Other parties on the left in Europe are also lagging behind, from France to Italy to the UK. In the US, a return of Donald Trump to the White House is not beyond the realm of possibility. Bar a few exceptions like Chile, Peru and New Zealand, parties on the Left seem to have lost their voter base. But at a time when the global economy is struggling with escalating energy costs, and with the daunting prospect of a protracted conflict in Ukraine, voters may be looking for leadership of the kind Bacik is offering. The tide may be turning. Vittorio Bufacchi is affiliated with Labour Party (Ireland).",

It was nearly 30 years later, in 2018, that a referendum was passed that changed the constitution and made abortion legal in Ireland . Today Bacik still recalls how she never forgot women\u2019s voices at the end of the phone line looking for a phone number for a clinic in England. For Bacik, reproductive healthcare was not only a gender issue and a human rights issue but also, always, an economic issue. In this sense, Bacik has always championed intersectional feminism \u2013 the idea that women\u2019s lives are constructed by multiple, converging, overlapping systems of oppression. A barrister by training, Bacik has a fierce intellect and a sharp analytical mind. For many years she has taught criminal law, criminology and penology, as well as feminist theory and law at Trinity College Dublin. And yet she remains one of the most approachable, amicable politicians in Ireland today. There are two main aspects that make Bacik\u2019s political outlook distinctive in the Irish political landscape. Her activism and her non-confrontational style. While most politicians have a tendency to take positions motivated by what is more likely to win them votes, Bacik appears to prioritise her principles and integrity. And she looks as comfortable on the streets talking to ordinary people as she is in parliament debating with other elected politicians. Just like her contemporary Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the US, it is impossible to separate Bacik the politician from Bacik the activist. And just like 20th century Marxist Rosa Luxemburg , Bacik lives by the credo that the most revolutionary thing one can do is always to proclaim loudly what is happening. To be an activist requires passion, commitment and fearlessness, but also humility and generosity. Activism, in particular left-wing activism, is essentially egalitarian. Its anti-hierarchical premises are grounded on the principles of solidarity. Bacik\u2019s work reflects this, whether on abortion or same-sex marriages, working conditions for freelancers or secular marriage, the rights of immigrants and refugees or the emergency of climate change, the needs of children with additional needs or promoting equality for LGBT+ community. Interestingly, Bacik is currently chairperson of the Oireachtas (parliamentary) Committee on Gender Equality , working to promote a referendum in 2023 on the outdated and sexist language concerning women in the Irish constitution. Take Article 41.1 on the family, for example, which reads: the State recognises that by her life within the home, woman gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved. The State shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home. Inequality is a symptom of structural injustice so work to challenge and change basic social, cultural, economic and legal adages when they are shown to be outdated is vital. Bacik is also pushing for a universal childcare system, providing community-based support for all. Childcare provision is a major stumbling block towards a more equal, fair society. The prohibitive cost of childcare in Ireland is one reason why many more women in Ireland work in part-time jobs compared to men , a fact that contributes to other ramifications of gender inequality across society. The present childcare system is one of the most obvious and deplorable sources of structural injustice and inequality in Ireland today. In my work , I have argued that social injustice is best understood in terms of three mutually reinforcing dimensions: maldistribution, exclusion, disempowerment. Those who are economically disadvantaged are also more likely to experience exclusion and, in turn, by being gradually disempowered, are less likely to stand up for their rights. That makes them less likely to become one of the few who benefit from the increasingly inequitable distribution of resources. As we emerge from a period of politics defined by vulgar and offensive language , simplistic slogans and the confrontational tone, Bacik\u2019s political style is refreshingly decent. She takes an accommodating approach to communication, prioritising listening and giving a voice to the voiceless and defending the cause of diversity and inclusion. In this respect, Bacik is not dissimilar from New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, who has always claimed that far from reflecting weakness, it takes strength to be an empathetic leader . The challenge facing all left-wing parties, in Ireland and around the world, is to win back the trust of the people they claim to represent \u2013 the least advantaged members of society, who feel marginalised and let down by democratic procedures. According to the most recent opinion poll support for Labour in Ireland now sits at 5%. Other parties on the left in Europe are also lagging behind, from France to Italy to the UK. In the US, a return of Donald Trump to the White House is not beyond the realm of possibility. Bar a few exceptions like Chile, Peru and New Zealand, parties on the Left seem to have lost their voter base. But at a time when the global economy is struggling with escalating energy costs, and with the daunting prospect of a protracted conflict in Ukraine, voters may be looking for leadership of the kind Bacik is offering. The tide may be turning.",

And eating red and processed meat can increase your risk of developing colorectal cancers. If eating less meat is good for you and the planet, then recent research has some good news: meat consumption \u2013 particularly red meat \u2013 is slowly falling in the UK. But for diet changes to really pick up the pace, it needs to be easier for everyone to make more sustainable and healthy choices. Surveys suggest that despite increasing support for the idea of eating less meat, the UK public has little appetite for interventions by the government to achieve this, whether that might be taxes, labelling or a media campaign. So what if shops and restaurants took the lead by providing more meat-free options to choose from? Would this make people more likely to eschew meat? It\u2019s not guaranteed \u2013 there are strong social influences and cultural norms that reinforce the appeal and habit of eating meat. For example, when asked why they eat meat, people often tend to describe meat as being \u201cnecessary, natural, normal and nice\u201d. Nonetheless, in three studies, my research team and I tested the effect of increasing meat-free options on the meals people choose. First, we looked at sales in a university cafeteria that changed the menu to offer two plant-based and one meat option, instead of one plant-based and two meat options, for four months. When a third of the options were meat-free, around 40% of the meals diners bought were meat-free. This rose to around 60% when two-thirds were meat-free. Making plant-based options more prominent on menus makes them seem less niche. PJjaruwan/Shutterstock In the second study, a nationwide catering company put more plant-based options on their list of meals for cafeteria managers to create their menus with. We analysed sales in 18 worksite cafeterias supplied by this company for the eight weeks before and eight weeks after the new list of meal options was available. Where there was a small increase in the number of plant-based meal options, sales of plant-based meals overall increased by a small amount, but only around half of the chefs took up the new menu options. In the third study, we recruited 2,205 UK adults to take part in an online questionnaire. We divided them into three groups, each having four main meals to choose from. Of these four options, either one, two or three were meat-free. Faced with three meat options, just 12% chose the meat-free meal, but when there were three meat-free options, 48% made that choice. Where options were equal, 28% opted for the meat-free choice. Less meat or meat-less To identify interventions that could help everyone eat less meat and not just those who already eat less than most, we looked at whether increasing meat-free options in our online study had a different effect on particular groups. Regardless of their usual meat consumption, everyone ate less meat when there were more meat-free options. This is encouraging, as it\u2019s possible to reduce meat consumption the most when everyone can cut back a bit, instead of a few people cutting back a lot or becoming vegetarian (though one person being vegan could potentially offset others taking no action). Having more meat-free meals on menus or in stores may have other benefits too. Without a wide enough range of meat-free options in shops and restaurants, other measures such as ecolabels \u2013 labelling food with its environmental impact to help people buy more sustainable products \u2013 may lose their bite. After all, how much can we expect labelling to change food choices if all the options have low ratings? We have research on this topic in the pipeline. Read more: Food and drink products with pro-environment 'ecolabels' are more appealing to shoppers \u2013 new research Making plant-based options more prominent may also begin to reverse public perceptions of meat-eating as the norm. Increasing the number of vegetarian options may signal that choosing a vegetarian meal is more commonly done by others and subconsciously nudge people to follow the trend. If just one of four options is meat-free, this could be seen as an option just for vegetarians. If half are meat-free, people have a choice of dishes which suggests plant-based food is in demand more generally, rather than being a niche choice. Of course, there is also a greater chance of there being one they would like. Plant-based meat alternatives are increasingly popular. Sheila Fitzgerald/Shutterstock Meat the deadline The National Food Strategy recommended that people in the UK eat 30% less meat by the end of the decade to reach net zero by 2050. People have ingrained habits, so it\u2019s important to find ways to help them make more sustainable food choices and to keep making them. Nearly three in four people believe it\u2019s important to buy sustainable food. Simple changes, such as providing more plant-based options in shops and restaurants, could help people to meet this goal. Adding appealing plant-based or vegetarian options to menus could get the ball rolling on the urgent changes needed, as well as enhance the impact of promising, but perhaps harder-to-implement measures, like ecolabels.

            "full_description": "Credit: Cathy Wilcox News from the Antarctic (\u201c Collapse of east Antarctica ice shelf raises alarm \u201d, March 29) validates the recent UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s report, which stressed that there is only a brief window of time to act as many impacts of global warming are now simply irreversible. Climate deniers should note that even blind Freddy can see the urgency and scale of the human task ahead to protect our precious environment. Remember, time and tide wait for no man. Steve Ngeow, Chatswood Despite the latest plain evidence of global warming from reputable sources: ice-sheet melting and coastal retreat, climate change sceptics and conspiracy theory merchants will only dig their heels in and harden their stance. Meanwhile, as the planet warms inexorably, Australia is the most vulnerable continent on the planet. The planet doesn\u2019t care that a good percentage of Australians don\u2019t believe they contribute to global warming. Geoff Black, Caves Beach Credit: John Shakespeare While ice sheets crash in the Antarctic, Lismore faces more flooding and, as irresponsible environmental damage continues, our government plays peripheral games to win over what it hopes is a credulous public. Donald Hawes, Peel Planning Minister Stuart Robert\u2019s recent decision to scrap principles that required councils to consider the risks of bushfires and floods before granting approvals for new houses seems short-sighted at the least. With more heavy rain and evacuations ordered once again in towns across northern NSW, his decision is looking worse by the day. Paul Parramore, Sawtell Conflicts all over the world can mostly be dealt with, but our biggest and most important \u201cwar\u201d on our hands is climate change. If attention isn\u2019t immediately paid to it, we will not have a planet to live on. We all like to have healthy bodies and, when really ill, we expect doctors and surgeons to fix us up, which they do. Our planet is no different. Scott Morrison and his government are missing in action. This planet is our only home. Look after and respect it; 2040 will be too late. Audrey Hutchison, Nowra I watched the television with dismay as the frazzled mayor of Lismore complained about the complicated form-filling people had to perform to get flood relief. He mentioned the bureaucracy wanted receipts for damaged items and how the people were so busy they didn\u2019t have time to fill in complicated forms. Compared with the largesse shown to big business during COVID-19 (a lot of which hasn\u2019t been returned), it is, as usual, the less-well-off citizens who have to wear the worst of government \u201chelp\u201d. William Perry, Mount Keira The catastrophic flooding of the northern rivers appears to have finally shut up the anti climate-change loudmouths of the Right. During its decade in power, the Coalition\u2019s damaging lack of action to ameliorate global warming, together with its support for a coal industry that continues to pollute the world and kill people, have shown us to be well on the way to being a pariah internationally. Ron Sinclair, Windradyne Gee, hasn\u2019t the past 1000 years passed quickly? Bill White, South Grafton Mis-pronounced names? ( Letters , March 29). I\u2019m often referred to as Miss/Ms/Mrs Panadol. I\u2019m pleased to say that it doesn\u2019t cause me pain. Rose Panidis, Graceville (Qld) My full given first name is Radmila, but I have been called Mila since childhood. When I tell people my name, a common response is, \u201cAnd what is your first name?\u201d thinking I had said the surname Miller. Maybe I started the trend of naming baby girls Mila, which is of Slavic origin and means gracious or dear, as I arrived in Australia over 70 years ago. The name is now in the top 100 baby girls names in Australia. Mila Yates, Valentine My unofficial last name seems to be \u201cas in paints\u201d, since that\u2019s what everyone says after I\u2019ve spelt it out yet again. And the first syllable is said \u201ctorb\u201d, not \u201ctaob\u201d. Andrew Taubman, Queens Park I\u2019ve long lost count of the times I\u2019ve seen my surname written minus the c. Same for \u201cand here he is in the flesh\u201d remarks. At the school I went to, we occasionally sang a hymn with the line \u201cthe spirit is willing but the flesh is weak\u201d, prompting grinning turned heads from in front and pokes in the back. Now in my 70s, I\u2019m used to it all. Daniel Flesch, Bellingen In the early \u201970s, I got a job with the Sydney Water Board, where \u201cWheelbarrow\u201d was the name you copped if yours wasn\u2019t Anglo-Saxon or was more than two syllables. Anthony Malivanek, Bray Park If the double-barrelled name is not enough, when I mention \u201chyphen\u201d, some people hesitate, not sure what to use. Some use commas, explanation marks, or a back or forward slash. I\u2019ve even been asked to spell hyphen. Peter Cowan-Lunn, Wentworth Falls One would think it would be my surname that causes difficulty, but I get Lyn, Lynne, Linda, Lynette, and sometimes Lynn. Once, when spelling my name out to someone, I was even asked, \u2033\u2063Are you sure?\u2033\u2063 Lynn Rattray, West Pennant Hills Spare a thought for Irish and Islander people while you are at it. For a time, I did not exist, according to one government department, because its system did not take account of the apostrophe, not to mention not being allowed to have two capitals in a surname. Chris O\u2019Rourke, Bathurst Having spent almost 75 years spelling out my surname, I am amazed at some of the alternate spellings. As a child, I was sent to pay our bill at the newsagent run by an Italian family. After looking through his ledger, he suddenly declared, \u201cIt\u2019s Poccocolo, your name is too hard to pronounce.\u201d Peter Pocock, Hornsby Tax cuts seem to be the go-to and an easy sell for a government trying to protect those who run aged care facilities and other enterprises farmed out to the private sector (\u201c Long-term debt recovery needed, not fuel excise cuts \u201d, March 29). Wage rises would cost these business owners directly and the government would have to increase funding, so tax cuts are an easy cop-out. But as the costs of doing business naturally increase, there is less tax to fund the running of these facilities and it becomes a downward spiral. Perhaps the Prime Minister can increase his backpackers tax to his originally suggested level. What can they say? They\u2019re not voters. Chris Gresham, Upper Lansdowne Jobs and wages are crucial election issues (\u201c Budget sets up election fight over jobs, wages \u201d, March 29). Scott Morrison definitely won\u2019t be fighting the election on properly addressing climate change, integrity and the urgent need for a federal corruption commission or the allocating of funding to electorates based on merit and not the sitting member\u2019s political stripe. John Cotterill, Kingsford The Coalition has spent nine years suppressing wages and conditions and now expect to make it the issue that will win them an election. Why didn\u2019t they just provide good government services over the past nine years? Philip Cadwallen, Werrington Build Unnecessary Debt Get Electoral Tick. Stuart Pratt, Ocean Shores Can Jessica Irvine be the new treasurer, please (\u201c Free childcare just the beginning \u201d, March 29)? Missing from her list of benefits of quality early childhood education are the long-term effects on all children, but especially disadvantaged children. Research shows this links to social skills including empathy, educational success and employment. Give the next generation the start they deserve.

Beats cheaper beer for the blokes. Terry Lavis, Coogee More people will be infected and more of the elderly will die until something is done about the large reservoir of susceptible children in schools (\u2034 \u2063\u2063Only had it seven weeks ago\u2019: More people report COVID-19 reinfection \u201d, smh.com.au, March 29). Until the children\u2019s vaccination rate rises above 40per cent, infections will run rampant. Unvaccinated people, including children, should not be allowed indoors with others when COVID-19 is in the community. This means no school for the unvaccinated. Not only would this significantly slow infections, but it would also give some people the incentive to do the right thing. I am currently home, unable to work, due to COVID-19 brought home from school. Bart Fielden, Lindfield With loss-making public transport devouring an ever-increasing proportion of the state budget and stealing funds needed for rural roads, your correspondent\u2019s plea for free public transport is nonsensical ( Letters , March 29). Unless Sydney\u2019s users pay for their shiny new public transport, non-users in the rest of our large state will have to pay and watch the disintegration of their roads continue. Michael Britt, Macmasters Beach It is clear from the academy\u2019s stance that the movie industry has learnt nothing through the #MeToo period (\u201c Slap in the face for Oscar winners \u201d, March 29). Chris Rock made a public humiliating statement clearly directed at Will Smith\u2019s wife for nothing more than a pathetic attempt at humour. His choice was scandalous. But the academy chooses to attack her chivalrous husband who does what any proud husband would do? While physical violence is never an answer, Smith slapped Rock\u2019s face, a centuries-old symbol that displays your feeling at being slighted. In fact, in days of the knights who wore armour, this was how you challenged for a duel. Rock took to a public forum to be inappropriate in the belief no one would react in public. He was wrong and deserved the slap. The academy should condemn Rock, and then Smith for reacting, and take no further action. Instead, it has attacked the victim and allowed the bully a free ride. Gary Bigelow, Teralba Regarding Will Smith hitting Chris Rock, where is the feminist commentary in this? Since when is it OK to walk up and strike another man when you don\u2019t like what he said about your wife? We teach our children to work things out in a calm manner, using their words. Did we all just make what Will Smith did acceptable because he was defending his wife? Like she is his property? Yes, Will, call it out when it is wrong, but society does not condone physical violence. Showing how powerfully violent men can be to control a situation does not warm the hearts of millions of women who have been subjected to this kind of manly control. It may take a long time for society to move away from the romantic idea of men who defend a lady\u2019s honour but we need to see it for what it is: unnecessary violence in the post #MeToo movement. Carla Gillis, Hallidays Point Thank goodness for the Oscars. Now I know what Will Smith, Chris Rock and poor form look like. Shane Joseph, Marsfield It\u2019s not just the caffeine we crave in a cafe ( Letters , March 29) but the \u201cHi\u201d, the welcome, the smile and to be remembered. Baristas have a complex job, indeed. Mary Julian, Glebe A correspondent speaks of a home coffee machine, costing \u201cunder two grand\u201d. Even more frugal method here \u2013 china jug topped with plastic filter, with filter papers and coffee (bought on special, when possible). $2a cup. Any better offers? Elizabeth Jones, Kirribilli All this kerfuffle lately over the spelling of names reminds me of a student\u2019s absentee note given to a colleague of mine. It was addressed \u201cDear Madman\u201d and to this day we have not determined whether it was intentional, or merely a misspelling of \u201cMadam\u201d. Terry Charleston, Cootamundra Your correspondent ( Letters , March 29) should visit Ballarat railway station, where there is a huge map showing 1890s Victoria riddled with railway lines. They go everywhere. And to towns that once existed. Clearly, the British took decentralisation and public transport seriously with their visions of A4 Class steam locomotives thundering off daily at their steady 160 km/h. Ronald Elliott, Sandringham (Vic) The digital view Online comment from one of the stories that attracted the most reader feedback yesterday on smh.com.au Australia warned to pay attention to PNG following China\u2019s Solomon Islands deal From rosebud : \u201cThis is the result of successive, excessive and relentless bullhorn politics, especially since Abbott. He cut foreign aid, was dismissive of climate change, slow with a handout and never a hand up. China is dangerous for all, especially the Solomons as hosts, but this is the result of our ignorance over many years.\u201d",

            "full_description": "Credit: Cathy Wilcox News from the Antarctic (\u201c Collapse of east Antarctica ice shelf raises alarm \u201d, March 29) validates the recent UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s report, which stressed that there is only a brief window of time to act as many impacts of global warming are now simply irreversible. Climate deniers should note that even blind Freddy can see the urgency and scale of the human task ahead to protect our precious environment. Remember, time and tide wait for no man. Steve Ngeow, Chatswood Despite the latest plain evidence of global warming from reputable sources: ice-sheet melting and coastal retreat, climate change sceptics and conspiracy theory merchants will only dig their heels in and harden their stance. Meanwhile, as the planet warms inexorably, Australia is the most vulnerable continent on the planet. The planet doesn\u2019t care that a good percentage of Australians don\u2019t believe they contribute to global warming. Geoff Black, Caves Beach Credit: John Shakespeare While ice sheets crash in the Antarctic, Lismore faces more flooding and, as irresponsible environmental damage continues, our government plays peripheral games to win over what it hopes is a credulous public. Donald Hawes, Peel Planning Minister Stuart Robert\u2019s recent decision to scrap principles that required councils to consider the risks of bushfires and floods before granting approvals for new houses seems short-sighted at the least. With more heavy rain and evacuations ordered once again in towns across northern NSW, his decision is looking worse by the day. Paul Parramore, Sawtell Conflicts all over the world can mostly be dealt with, but our biggest and most important \u201cwar\u201d on our hands is climate change. If attention isn\u2019t immediately paid to it, we will not have a planet to live on. We all like to have healthy bodies and, when really ill, we expect doctors and surgeons to fix us up, which they do. Our planet is no different. Scott Morrison and his government are missing in action. This planet is our only home. Look after and respect it; 2040 will be too late. Audrey Hutchison, Nowra I watched the television with dismay as the frazzled mayor of Lismore complained about the complicated form-filling people had to perform to get flood relief. He mentioned the bureaucracy wanted receipts for damaged items and how the people were so busy they didn\u2019t have time to fill in complicated forms. Compared with the largesse shown to big business during COVID-19 (a lot of which hasn\u2019t been returned), it is, as usual, the less-well-off citizens who have to wear the worst of government \u201chelp\u201d. William Perry, Mount Keira The catastrophic flooding of the northern rivers appears to have finally shut up the anti climate-change loudmouths of the Right. During its decade in power, the Coalition\u2019s damaging lack of action to ameliorate global warming, together with its support for a coal industry that continues to pollute the world and kill people, have shown us to be well on the way to being a pariah internationally. Ron Sinclair, Windradyne Gee, hasn\u2019t the past 1000 years passed quickly? Bill White, South Grafton Mis-pronounced names? ( Letters , March 29). I\u2019m often referred to as Miss/Ms/Mrs Panadol. I\u2019m pleased to say that it doesn\u2019t cause me pain. Rose Panidis, Graceville (Qld) My full given first name is Radmila, but I have been called Mila since childhood. When I tell people my name, a common response is, \u201cAnd what is your first name?\u201d thinking I had said the surname Miller. Maybe I started the trend of naming baby girls Mila, which is of Slavic origin and means gracious or dear, as I arrived in Australia over 70 years ago. The name is now in the top 100 baby girls names in Australia. Mila Yates, Valentine My unofficial last name seems to be \u201cas in paints\u201d, since that\u2019s what everyone says after I\u2019ve spelt it out yet again. And the first syllable is said \u201ctorb\u201d, not \u201ctaob\u201d. Andrew Taubman, Queens Park I\u2019ve long lost count of the times I\u2019ve seen my surname written minus the c. Same for \u201cand here he is in the flesh\u201d remarks. At the school I went to, we occasionally sang a hymn with the line \u201cthe spirit is willing but the flesh is weak\u201d, prompting grinning turned heads from in front and pokes in the back. Now in my 70s, I\u2019m used to it all. Daniel Flesch, Bellingen In the early \u201970s, I got a job with the Sydney Water Board, where \u201cWheelbarrow\u201d was the name you copped if yours wasn\u2019t Anglo-Saxon or was more than two syllables. Anthony Malivanek, Bray Park If the double-barrelled name is not enough, when I mention \u201chyphen\u201d, some people hesitate, not sure what to use. Some use commas, explanation marks, or a back or forward slash. I\u2019ve even been asked to spell hyphen. Peter Cowan-Lunn, Wentworth Falls One would think it would be my surname that causes difficulty, but I get Lyn, Lynne, Linda, Lynette, and sometimes Lynn. Once, when spelling my name out to someone, I was even asked, \u2033\u2063Are you sure?\u2033\u2063 Lynn Rattray, West Pennant Hills Spare a thought for Irish and Islander people while you are at it. For a time, I did not exist, according to one government department, because its system did not take account of the apostrophe, not to mention not being allowed to have two capitals in a surname. Chris O\u2019Rourke, Bathurst Having spent almost 75 years spelling out my surname, I am amazed at some of the alternate spellings. As a child, I was sent to pay our bill at the newsagent run by an Italian family. After looking through his ledger, he suddenly declared, \u201cIt\u2019s Poccocolo, your name is too hard to pronounce.\u201d Peter Pocock, Hornsby Tax cuts seem to be the go-to and an easy sell for a government trying to protect those who run aged care facilities and other enterprises farmed out to the private sector (\u201c Long-term debt recovery needed, not fuel excise cuts \u201d, March 29). Wage rises would cost these business owners directly and the government would have to increase funding, so tax cuts are an easy cop-out. But as the costs of doing business naturally increase, there is less tax to fund the running of these facilities and it becomes a downward spiral. Perhaps the Prime Minister can increase his backpackers tax to his originally suggested level. What can they say? They\u2019re not voters. Chris Gresham, Upper Lansdowne Jobs and wages are crucial election issues (\u201c Budget sets up election fight over jobs, wages \u201d, March 29). Scott Morrison definitely won\u2019t be fighting the election on properly addressing climate change, integrity and the urgent need for a federal corruption commission or the allocating of funding to electorates based on merit and not the sitting member\u2019s political stripe. John Cotterill, Kingsford The Coalition has spent nine years suppressing wages and conditions and now expect to make it the issue that will win them an election. Why didn\u2019t they just provide good government services over the past nine years? Philip Cadwallen, Werrington Build Unnecessary Debt Get Electoral Tick. Stuart Pratt, Ocean Shores Can Jessica Irvine be the new treasurer, please (\u201c Free childcare just the beginning \u201d, March 29)? Missing from her list of benefits of quality early childhood education are the long-term effects on all children, but especially disadvantaged children. Research shows this links to social skills including empathy, educational success and employment. Give the next generation the start they deserve. Jenny Forster, Manly Free childcare would change more than half the population\u2019s lives in one easy stroke, thank you, Jessica Irvine \u2014 not just those of women, but for families\u2019 quality of life now and in the future. Beats cheaper beer for the blokes. Terry Lavis, Coogee More people will be infected and more of the elderly will die until something is done about the large reservoir of susceptible children in schools (\u2034 \u2063\u2063Only had it seven weeks ago\u2019: More people report COVID-19 reinfection \u201d, smh.com.au, March 29). Until the children\u2019s vaccination rate rises above 40per cent, infections will run rampant. Unvaccinated people, including children, should not be allowed indoors with others when COVID-19 is in the community. This means no school for the unvaccinated. Not only would this significantly slow infections, but it would also give some people the incentive to do the right thing. I am currently home, unable to work, due to COVID-19 brought home from school. Bart Fielden, Lindfield With loss-making public transport devouring an ever-increasing proportion of the state budget and stealing funds needed for rural roads, your correspondent\u2019s plea for free public transport is nonsensical ( Letters , March 29). Unless Sydney\u2019s users pay for their shiny new public transport, non-users in the rest of our large state will have to pay and watch the disintegration of their roads continue. Michael Britt, Macmasters Beach It is clear from the academy\u2019s stance that the movie industry has learnt nothing through the #MeToo period (\u201c Slap in the face for Oscar winners \u201d, March 29). Chris Rock made a public humiliating statement clearly directed at Will Smith\u2019s wife for nothing more than a pathetic attempt at humour. His choice was scandalous. But the academy chooses to attack her chivalrous husband who does what any proud husband would do? While physical violence is never an answer, Smith slapped Rock\u2019s face, a centuries-old symbol that displays your feeling at being slighted. In fact, in days of the knights who wore armour, this was how you challenged for a duel. Rock took to a public forum to be inappropriate in the belief no one would react in public. He was wrong and deserved the slap. The academy should condemn Rock, and then Smith for reacting, and take no further action. Instead, it has attacked the victim and allowed the bully a free ride. Gary Bigelow, Teralba Regarding Will Smith hitting Chris Rock, where is the feminist commentary in this? Since when is it OK to walk up and strike another man when you don\u2019t like what he said about your wife? We teach our children to work things out in a calm manner, using their words. Did we all just make what Will Smith did acceptable because he was defending his wife? Like she is his property? Yes, Will, call it out when it is wrong, but society does not condone physical violence. Showing how powerfully violent men can be to control a situation does not warm the hearts of millions of women who have been subjected to this kind of manly control. It may take a long time for society to move away from the romantic idea of men who defend a lady\u2019s honour but we need to see it for what it is: unnecessary violence in the post #MeToo movement. Carla Gillis, Hallidays Point Thank goodness for the Oscars. Now I know what Will Smith, Chris Rock and poor form look like. Shane Joseph, Marsfield It\u2019s not just the caffeine we crave in a cafe ( Letters , March 29) but the \u201cHi\u201d, the welcome, the smile and to be remembered. Baristas have a complex job, indeed. Mary Julian, Glebe A correspondent speaks of a home coffee machine, costing \u201cunder two grand\u201d. Even more frugal method here \u2013 china jug topped with plastic filter, with filter papers and coffee (bought on special, when possible). $2a cup. Any better offers? Elizabeth Jones, Kirribilli All this kerfuffle lately over the spelling of names reminds me of a student\u2019s absentee note given to a colleague of mine. It was addressed \u201cDear Madman\u201d and to this day we have not determined whether it was intentional, or merely a misspelling of \u201cMadam\u201d. Terry Charleston, Cootamundra Your correspondent ( Letters , March 29) should visit Ballarat railway station, where there is a huge map showing 1890s Victoria riddled with railway lines. They go everywhere. And to towns that once existed. Clearly, the British took decentralisation and public transport seriously with their visions of A4 Class steam locomotives thundering off daily at their steady 160 km/h. Ronald Elliott, Sandringham (Vic) The digital view Online comment from one of the stories that attracted the most reader feedback yesterday on smh.com.au Australia warned to pay attention to PNG following China\u2019s Solomon Islands deal From rosebud : \u201cThis is the result of successive, excessive and relentless bullhorn politics, especially since Abbott. He cut foreign aid, was dismissive of climate change, slow with a handout and never a hand up. China is dangerous for all, especially the Solomons as hosts, but this is the result of our ignorance over many years.\u201d",

            "content": "The ocean retains heat for much longer than land does. Aliraza Khatri's Photography via Getty ImagesGlobal warming doesn\u2019t stop on a dime. If people everywhere stopped burning fossil fuels tomorrow, stored heat would still continue to warm the atmosphere. Picture how a radiator heats a home. Water is heated by a boiler, and the hot water circulates through pipes and radiators in the house. The radiators warm up and heat the air in the room. Even after the boiler is turned off, the already heated water is still circulating through the system, heating the house. The radiators are, in fact, cooling down, but their stored heat is still warming the air in the room. This is known as committed warming. Earth similarly has ways of storing and releasing heat. Emerging research is refining scientists\u2019 understanding of how Earth\u2019s committed warming will affect the climate. Where we once thought it would take 40 years or longer for global surface air temperature to peak once humans stopped heating up the planet, research now suggests temperature could peak in closer to 10 years. But that doesn\u2019t mean the planet returns to its preindustrial climate or that we avoid disruptive effects such as sea level rise. I am a professor of climate science, and my research and teaching focus on the usability of climate knowledge by practitioners such as urban planners, public health professionals and policymakers. With a new report on mitigating climate change expected from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in early April, let\u2019s take a look at the bigger picture. How understanding of peak warming has changed Historically, the first climate models represented only the atmosphere and were greatly simplified. Over the years, scientists added oceans, land, ice sheets, chemistry and biology. Today\u2019s models can more explicitly represent the behavior of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide. That allows scientists to better separate heating due to carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from the role of heat stored in the ocean. Why global warming is ocean warming. Thinking about our radiator analogy, increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in Earth\u2019s atmosphere keep the boiler on \u2013 holding energy near the surface and raising the temperature. Heat accumulates and is stored, mostly in the oceans, which take on the role of the radiators. The heat is distributed around the world through weather and oceanic currents. The current understanding is that if all of the additional heating to the planet caused by humans was eliminated, a plausible outcome is that Earth would reach a global surface air temperature peak in closer to 10 years than 40. The previous estimate of 40 or more years has been widely used over the years, including by me. It is important to note that this is only the peak, when the temperature starts to stabilize \u2013 not the onset of rapid cooling or a reversal of climate change. I believe there is enough uncertainty to justify caution about exaggerating the significance of the new research\u2019s results. The authors applied the concept of peak warming to global surface air temperature. Global surface air temperature is, metaphorically, the temperature in the \u201croom,\u201d and is not the best measure of climate change. The concept of instantly cutting off human-caused heating is also idealized and entirely unrealistic \u2013 doing that would involve much more than just ending fossil fuel use, including widespread changes to agriculture \u2013 and it only helps illustrate how parts of the climate might behave. Even if the air temperature were to peak and stabilize, \u201ccommitted ice melting,\u201d \u201ccommitted sea level rise\u201d and numerous other land and biological trends would continue to evolve from the accumulated heat. Some of these could, in fact, cause a release of carbon dioxide and methane, especially from the Arctic and other high-latitude reservoirs that are currently frozen. For these reasons and others, it is important to consider the how far into the future studies like this one look. Oceans in the future Oceans will continue to store heat and exchange it with the atmosphere. Even if emissions stopped, the excess heat that has been accumulating in the ocean since preindustrial times would influence the climate for another 100 years or more. Because the ocean is dynamic, it has currents, and it will not simply diffuse its excess heat back into the atmosphere. There will be ups and downs as the temperature adjusts. The oceans also influence the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, because carbon dioxide is both absorbed and emitted by the oceans. Paleoclimate studies show large changes in carbon dioxide and temperature in the past, with the oceans playing an important role. The chart shows how excess heat \u2013 thermal energy \u2013 has built up in ocean, land, ice and atmosphere since 1960 and moved to greater ocean depths with time.

            "full_description": "Global warming doesn\u2019t stop on a dime. If people everywhere stopped burning fossil fuels tomorrow, stored heat would still continue to warm the atmosphere. Picture how a radiator heats a home. Water is heated by a boiler, and the hot water circulates through pipes and radiators in the house. The radiators warm up and heat the air in the room. Even after the boiler is turned off, the already heated water is still circulating through the system, heating the house. The radiators are, in fact, cooling down, but their stored heat is still warming the air in the room. This is known as committed warming . Earth similarly has ways of storing and releasing heat. Emerging research is refining scientists\u2019 understanding of how Earth\u2019s committed warming will affect the climate. Where we once thought it would take 40 years or longer for global surface air temperature to peak once humans stopped heating up the planet, research now suggests temperature could peak in closer to 10 years . But that doesn\u2019t mean the planet returns to its preindustrial climate or that we avoid disruptive effects such as sea level rise. I am a professor of climate science, and my research and teaching focus on the usability of climate knowledge by practitioners such as urban planners, public health professionals and policymakers. With a new report on mitigating climate change expected from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in early April, let\u2019s take a look at the bigger picture. Historically, the first climate models represented only the atmosphere and were greatly simplified. Over the years, scientists added oceans , land, ice sheets, chemistry and biology. Today\u2019s models can more explicitly represent the behavior of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide. That allows scientists to better separate heating due to carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from the role of heat stored in the ocean. Thinking about our radiator analogy, increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in Earth\u2019s atmosphere keep the boiler on \u2013 holding energy near the surface and raising the temperature.

            "full_description": "Climate change solutions for consumers typically are held to be home solar power systems, energy storage systems, electric vehicles or hybrid gas-electric vehicles, energy-efficient appliances, better home insulation, net-zero construction, and so forth. Broadly speaking, food waste is not at the top of such lists. Food waste does contribute to climate change and significantly. Producing and transporting food generates CO2 and placing food waste in landfills causes methane to be generated. Methane contributes to climate changes many more times than CO2 \u2014 once source says 28\u201334 times more. Solar power, wind power, energy storage, and electrified transportation might be more interesting or exciting \u2014 some people really like their EVs \u2014 but food waste is a challenge we should not overlook. Food waste might not seem like such a \u2018big deal\u2019 to the unaware, but just consider this little factoid : \u201c If food waste were a country , it would be third only to China and the United States in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d For those of use who are trying to reduce our climate change impacts, food waste is another important consideration. Jesse Tran and Son Chu, the founders of Rens Original , answered some questions about their shoes made from waste coffee grounds and recycled plastic pellets for CleanTechnica . How did you have the idea to recycle and repurpose coffee waste to make shoes? Jesse Tran: Coffee wasn\u2019t our original idea. The first shoes we ever created were made from 100% organic cotton, but after some months we were not convinced by the design and we realized we needed an alternative. We didn\u2019t launch them to the market, but we showed it around to our friends and experts and the feedback wasn\u2019t great, so we went back to the drawing board. Son Chu: Choosing coffee stemmed from its worldwide waste and design capabilities. Our signature coffee yarn helps cut the amount of methane-producing food waste that ends up trapped in our landfills while providing a material that is UV-protective, odor-fighting, moisture-wicking, and quick-drying. Image credit: Rens How does coffee waste contribute to climate change and what can be done to reduce or eliminate its impact? Jesse: When we started, we actually realized that only 5% of the coffee waste in the world actually gets recycled. Coffee waste is a bio waste, but it produces a lot of methane, which is about 32 times more potent than CO2. So what we do here is simply extend the life cycle by repurposing it for alternate use. There\u2019s an interesting connection between Vietnam (where we were born) and Finland (where we have lived for the past 10 years) \u2014 Vietnam is the second-largest coffee producer globally, while Finland has the global largest coffee consumption per capita. How do you convert coffee waste into shoe materials, and which materials do you make from the waste? Jesse: The raw materials are sourced locally from Vietnam and the neighboring countries, China and Taiwan. Our supplier collects it from convenience stores and big chains there. After you drink the coffee and throw the coffee grounds away, we actually mix it with recycled plastic pellets made from used water bottles. We then create something called coffee polyester yarn. The upper part of our shoes is made from this material. The same coffee polyester yarn that we use for the upper part of our sneakers is included in our newest product, the Elemental Hoodie that we just launched on the 29th March, available in our websites in the US, the UK, and the EU. This is our first apparel collection and we wanted to include our signature materials for it. Made from 43 cups of coffee grounds and 12.5 post-consumption plastic bottles, the hoodie also consists of 40% of bamboo viscose. Were you concerned about climate change before you learned about the coffee waste or did you learn about the waste and its impacts and then develop the desire to take action? Son: In the market, sustainable products are really popular. What we see as a problem is that those products are not made for young people. The way that they are selling the products is like: \u2018Hey, use us or else the planet is going to die.\u2019 We don\u2019t like that approach. We want to be a brand where we make sustainable products, but they are cool, they have amazing functions and people can actually use them. Before you founded Rens, did you have business or startup experience? How did you fund yourselves initially? Jesse: Rens started as a conversation between me and Son about the environmental impacts of the global sneaker industry and the less-than-stylish sustainable options on the market. I worked as CEO and Founder of Factory Finder, an online platform that connected European fashion brands with sustainable suppliers in Vietnam and China, and Son was one of the youngest developers at Zalando, Europe\u2019s largest ecommerce company. We combined our sustainable and innovative talents to tackle our mission of creating a stylish and durable sustainable sneaker. What is a quick snapshot or summary of lessons about creating a business with a sustainability focus, so far? Funny enough, we launched our Direct-to-consumer webstore right before the pandemic went south in early 2020. That was probably one of the most exciting and challenging experiences of the entire process, navigating the brands through the COVID era. Production was delayed, logistics was heavily interrupted, and we struggled to deliver the products to customers in time. However, at the end of the day, we managed to weather the storm and grow the brand\u00b4s global presence via our own webstore and Zalando with our biggest markets including the US, Germany, Finland, and the UK. Rens started as a brand for the community as we launched and financed our first product \u2014 the world\u2019s first coffee sneakers \u2014 on a crowdfunding platform. For our second launch, NOMAD performance sneaker, we went back to our roots in Kickstarter. We were able to design from the feedback of our backers from the first campaign, who specifically asked for a sneaker made for sports activities. Launching the second model on such a crowdfunding platform allows us to keep developing community-focused products while letting our customers participate in the creation process, and that\u2019s very exciting. Sustainable materials are way more expensive than synthetic ones and that had been a challenge for us, as we want to offer products that are environmentally friendly but affordable for young people. Choosing Kickstarter and pre-order for our launches also helps the sustainable focus, as we only produce under demand cutting energy usage and material waste. Rens only uses GRS, FSC, and RCS certified materials from the first step of the production until the last-mile shipping in order to reduce climate footprint and it\u2019s not easy to find the right partners and suppliers that comply with these credentials. How many shoes have you sold so far, and is your business growing? Son: Since we launched we\u2019ve sold over 30k pairs of sneakers in more than 100 countries around the world. So far, we\u2019ve been able to recycle over 750,000 cups of coffee and more than 250,000 post-consumption plastic bottles. Now with the creation of our first coffee waste hoodie, the recycled materials will continue to grow. Jesse: We see Rens becoming the global leader in sustainable athleisure from Europe. The current and future Rens\u2019 offerings will be made from waste-based materials and packed with innovative technologies. On top of that, together with the new hoodie, the first 2022 lucky customers will receive a hoodie NFT in our aim to enter the digital space. These NFTs are built in Polygon, the most sustainable blockchain alternative and their energy usage will be completely offset with our partner Aerial. What are your plans for the next several years? Jesse: We will continue our mission to promote sustainable fashion through technology and innovation. The launch of our exclusive limited run of NFTs alongside our Elemental Hoodie Collection shows how we are able to drive innovation in both the physical and digital space simultaneously, whilst also building on our sustainability credentials. We wholeheartedly believe that this is just the beginning of a MetaPhysical revolution in sustainable fashion and have ambitions to see Rens products in every single corner of the real world and the metaverse.

            "description": "As UK raises temperatures that define heatwave, here's how India measures heat",
            "full_description": "The United Kingdom on Monday raised the temperature at which forecasters will declare a heatwave in an area as climate change makes these extreme weather events more frequent. The UK Meteorological office raised the thresholds in some counties from 27 degrees Celsius to 28 degrees Celsius threshold and in others from 26 degrees Celsius to 27 degrees Celsius followed by 25 degrees Celsius to 26 degrees Celsius in one. The decision comes in the backdrop of global warming intensifying the occurrence of these weather-related events. A s the world grapples with heat waves, India is no different . The India Meteorological Department on Tuesday predicted a heatwave spell over Northwest, Central & West India for the coming four to five days. The IMD in a statement said that there could be a gradual rise in maximum temperatures by about 2 degrees Celsius over many parts of Central and East India during the next three days. The weather agency warned that heatwave could lead to moderate health concerns for vulnerable people and there is an increased likelihood of heat illness symptoms in people who are either exposed to the sun for a prolonged period or doing heavy work. A woman carries water can on her head, on a hot summer day, at Fort St George, in Chennai, Thursday, March 24, 2022. (PTI Photo) HOW DOES IMD DEFINE HEATWAVE IN INDIA? A heatwave is defined when a region experiences predominantly high temperatures for a sustained period of time. The India Meteorological Department defines a heatwave as a condition of air temperature which becomes fatal to the human body when exposed. \"It is defined based on the temperature thresholds over a region in terms of actual temperature or its departure from normal. In certain countries, it is defined in terms of the heat index based on temperature and humidity or based on the extreme percentile of the temperatures.\" IMD considers an area experiencing a heatwave if the maximum temperature of a station reaches at least 40 degrees Celsius or more for the plains and at least 30 degrees Celcius or more for hilly regions. A heatwave is also characterised if the temperature goes at least 4.5 to 6.4 notches up and if ts exceeds over 6.4 degrees Celcius above normal, the IMD classifies it as a severe heatwave. Meanwhile, when it comes to coastal regions, a heatwave is announced if the maximum temperature is 4.5 degrees Celsius or more than the normal temperature experienced in the area. The IMD in its latest projections has predicted a gradual rise in maximum temperatures by about 2 degrees Celsius. (File PIc) WHY IS THE HEATWAVE THRESHOLD SO HIGH IN INDIA? The heatwave threshold in India is high compared to what the United Kingdom has deemed fit to declare a heatwave, since India has tropical weather conditions where temperatures are generally high. Senior IMD scientist R K Jenamani told indiatoday.in that heatwave thresholds differ across the world based on the climatic factors experienced in those regions. \"Different countries have different climatic conditions, scoping capabilities and therefore, while in some countries it's high, in others it's low. The Indian sub-continent has a tropical climate with high temperatures. Therefore, in countries like India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka heatwave is declared at higher temperatures compared to that of the United Kingdom.\" The senior scientist denied any plans for the weather agency to alter the heatwave threshold for the country in the coming times, even as he acknowledged that climate change is leading to extreme weather events across the world. Temperatures recorded across India on March 28. (IMD) IMD'S LATEST PREDICTION: MORE HEAT INCOMING The IMD in its latest projections has predicted a gradual rise in maximum temperatures by about 2 degrees Celsius very likely over many parts of Central and East India during the next three days. A rise in maximum temperatures by 2-4 degrees Celsius is very likely over Maharashtra during the next five days. The weather agency has also predicted severe heatwave conditions in most parts very likely over West Rajasthan, in some parts over East Rajasthan & West Madhya Pradesh on March 29, 30. While parts of North India and Central India, northeast India is likely to experience light to moderate rainfall during the next five days with a possibility of isolated heavy falls over Assam-Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh on March 31 and April 1. Maximum temperatures have been rising in Delhi and parts of the national capital region in the last couple of days, hovering between 39-41 degrees Celsius. However, the IMD said that for it to declare a heatwave or severe heatwave the temperatures need to be consistently above normal by 4.5 degrees.",

            "full_description": "Climate change: Utilities planning projects that blend hydrogen with natural gas to curb emissions may find their efforts yield few climate benefits and trigger higher electricity bills for customers, according to a new U.S. study. Research shows that mixing hydrogen and gas for use in buildings and power generation is highly inefficient and does little to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, according to a report released Tuesday by Energy Innovation, a San Francisco-based energy policy think tank. \u201cIn the face of growing momentum and enthusiasm for hydrogen, state utility regulators and policymakers should be highly scrupulous and discerning of hydrogen blending proposals and avoid costly dead ends on the road to a decarbonized future,\u201d the report said. Natural gas and electric utilities have proposed at least 26 hydrogen projects since 2020 to reduce their environmental footprint. The companies see clean-burning hydrogen as a potential climate-friendly alternative to using natural gas over the long run. Gas utilities, in particular are looking at blending hydrogen into their pipeline networks as way to decarbonize operations and preserve or repurpose existing infrastructure. Yet using hydrogen in buildings creates \u201cmajor challenges and safety risks\u201d throughout existing natural gas systems because of the chemical differences between hydrogen and methane, the primary component of natural gas, according to the report. Hydrogen can\u2019t be readily swapped for methane for use in heating or household appliances above a 5% to 20% blend with natural gas without enormous cost, and low blends achieve few emissions reductions while increasing lung-damaging nitrogen oxide pollution. Hydrogen-blending projects also might thwart or delay more viable and cost-effective carbon-cutting strategies, such as electrifying homes and buildings with clean power, according to the study. \u201cDirect electrification of homes and buildings is the most straightforward way to decarbonize the building sector, save consumers money and improve public health,\u201d said Sara Baldwin, electrification policy director at Energy Innovation, and one of the report\u2019s authors.",

But despite some significant multi-billion dollar spends within the next six months, the deficit is predicted to shrink considerably from last year (and the shock of 2020) to just $79.8 billion \u2013 largely due to factors out of the government\u2019s control. While GDP surged as we began to see a way out of the COVID tunnel, the government forecasts that this will slowly consolidate to around about our pre-pandemic levels, sitting at 2.5% for the remainder of the forward estimates. Unlike GDP, unemployment is forecast to head further south \u2013 and remain there for the majority of the next four years. And the predicted further increase in overall employment has flown on effects. Despite an international climate of increasing inflation, and years of wage stagnation, the government is optimistic that the wage price index will overtake the consumer price index by the 2023-24 budget. Despite a clear explosion in spending in this election year (and amid those cost of living woes in the electorate), the government expects to rein in payments in the coming years, as receipts consolidate. Josh Frydenberg noted in his address to the Press Gallery that the budget now forecasts gross debt to peak four years earlier than in previous estimates \u2013 though this is still a far cry from the \u201cBack in Black\u201d predictions of his first budget in 2019. So what are the major spends \u2013 and few cuts \u2013 of this big spending election budget? While a number of them \u2013 like the fuel excise cut and almost no mention of climate change as NSW and Queensland recover from another disastrous summer \u2013 are definitely against the recommendations of Australia\u2019s leading economists, it remains to be seen how they will affect the election.",

            "content": "In The News is a roundup of stories from The Canadian Press designed to kickstart your day. Here is what\u2019s on the radar of our editors for the morning of March 29 \u2026 What we are watching in Canada \u2026 Canada\u2019s families minister says upcoming childcare legislation will enshrine a long-term role for the federal government in the national daycare system. Karina Gould says the law would also include the principles provinces and territories signed onto in funding agreements, including cutting fees for parents and creating more spaces. Gould says her aim was to introduce a bill by this spring, but she now has until the end of the year as part of the confidence and supply agreement with the NDP. Federal officials have been quietly consulting experts on what should be in the law. The consultation document obtained by The Canadian Press says the legislation could commit to \u201congoing collaboration\u201d between the federal, provincial and territorial governments over the daycare system, including a pledge for \u201csustained federal funding.\u201d The paper also suggests annual public reports and a national advisory council could be included as part of \u201cvarious mechanisms\u201d to ensure federal accountability. \u2014 Also this \u2026 Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault will table a new greenhouse gas emissions plan in Parliament this morning. The plan is a legal requirement under the net-zero accountability law the Liberals passed last year. It will model emissions projections for different sectors that are feasible and necessary to achieve Canada\u2019s current goal to curb emissions to no more than 60 per cent of what they were in 2005 before the end of the decade. The plan was supposed to be tabled by the end of December but Guilbeault exercised a clause allowing him to ask for three more months. He says Canadians will see something in the plan they never have before: a road map to actually meet a climate target. Canada has issued at least 11 plans and set nine different emissions targets since 1988, but has never met a single one of them. \u2014 And this \u2026 The NDP says a promise to ban the use of replacement workers in lockouts and strikes at federally regulated workplaces is a \u201chuge win.\u201d The party\u2019s deputy labour critic, Matthew Green, says federal agreement to include the measure in a planned law was a key part of negotiating the recent confidence and supply deal with the Liberals. Unions have been calling for the change for decades \u2013 and are celebrating the news. But the Canadian Federation of Independent Business says any prolonged job action in critical federal infrastructure will hurt business owners across the country. A 2009 study shows so-called \u201canti-scab\u201d laws lead to more frequent strikes, but they aren\u2019t as long. Labour Minister Seamus O\u2019Regan says the government will be doing policy research and consultations before introducing the bill by the end of next year. \u2014 What we are watching in the U.S. \u2026 California\u2019s first-in-the-nation task force on reparations is at a crossroads, with members divided on which Black Americans should be eligible for compensation as atonement for a slave system that officially ended with the Civil War but reverberates to this day. Some members want to limit financial and other compensation to descendants of enslaved people while others say that all Black people in the U.S., regardless of lineage, suffer from systemic racism in housing, education and employment. The task force could vote on eligibility on Tuesday after putting it off last month. Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation creating the two-year reparations task force in 2020, making California the only state to move ahead with a study and plan, with a mission to study the institution of slavery and its harms and to educate the public about its findings. The committee is not even a year into its two-year process and there is no compensation plan of any kind on the table. But there is broad agreement among advocates of the need for multi-faceted remedies for related yet separate harms, such as slavery, Jim Crow laws, mass incarceration and redevelopment that resulted in displacement of Black communities. Compensation could include free college, assistance buying homes and launching businesses, and grants to churches and community organizations, advocates say. Yet, the eligibility question has dogged the group since its inaugural meeting in June, when viewers called in pleading with the nine-member group to devise targeted proposals and cash payments to make whole the descendants of people enslaved in the U.S. California Secretary of State Shirley Weber, who authored the legislation creating the task force, had argued passionately in January for prioritizing descendants for generations of forced labour, broken family ties and police terrorism. The daughter of sharecroppers forced to flee Arkansas in the dead of night, she recalled how the legacy of slavery broke her family and stunted their ability to dream of anything beyond survival. Opening up compensation to Black immigrants or even descendants of slaves from other countries would leave U.S. descendants with mere pennies, she said. \u2014 What we are watching in the rest of the world \u2026 LVIV, Ukraine _ Another round of talks aimed at stopping the war in Ukraine was scheduled for Tuesday as the fighting appeared stalemated on the ground, with the two sides trading control of a town in the east and a suburb of the capital. Ukrainian forces retook Irpin, northwest of Kyiv, from Russian troops, who were regrouping to take the area back, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said late Monday as he sought to rally the country. \u201cWe still have to fight, we have to endure,\u201d Zelenskyy said in his nighttime video address to the nation. \u201cWe can\u2019t express our emotions now. We can\u2019t raise expectations, simply so that we don\u2019t burn out.\u201d Ahead of the talks in Istanbul, the Ukrainian president said his country is prepared to declare its neutrality, as Moscow has demanded, in comments that might lend momentum to negotiations. Zelenskyy said over the weekend that compromise might be possible over \u201cthe complex issue of Donbas,\u201d the hotly contested region in the country\u2019s east. It\u2019s unclear how that might be reconciled with his stance that \u201cUkraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity are beyond doubt.\u201d Russia has long demanded that Ukraine drop any hope of joining NATO, which Moscow sees as a threat. Zelenskyy, for his part, has stressed that Ukraine needs security guarantees of its own as part of any deal. As fighting raged throughout the country, the mayor of Irpin, which has been the scene of some of the heaviest fighting, said the city had been \u201cliberated\u201d from Russian forces. A senior U.S. defence official said the U.S. believes the Ukrainians have also retaken the town of Trostyanets, south of Sumy, in the east. \u2014 On this day in 1848 \u2026 Niagara Falls stopped flowing for the only time in recorded history.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences condemned Smith striking Rock, who had made a joke about his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, and said it would launch an inquiry. Later in the day, Smith gave a stronger apology than he did in his best actor acceptance speech, which notably hadn\u2019t included an apology to Rock. \u201cViolence in all of its forms is poisonous and destructive,\u201d said Smith in a statement issued by his publicist and posted on Instagram. \u201cMy behaviour at last night\u2019s Academy Awards was unacceptable and inexcusable. Jokes at my expense are a part of the job, but a joke about Jada\u2019s medical condition was too much for me to bear and I reacted emotionally. I would like to publicly apologize to you, Chris. I was out of line and I was wrong. I am embarrassed and my actions were not indicative of the man I want to be. There is no place for violence in a world of love and kindness.\u201d The 53-year-old actor added apologies to the film academy, producers of the telecast, attendees, viewers and the Williams family. Smith was honoured Sunday for his role as Richard Williams, father of Venus and Serena, in \u201cKing Richard.\u201d \u201cI am a work in progress,\u201d added Smith. After calling a board of governors meeting Monday to discuss the incident, the film academy said that it review Smith\u2019s actions and \u201cwill explore further action and consequences in accordance with our bylaws, standards of conduct and California law.\u201d The Los Angeles Police Department said Sunday it was aware of the incident but was not pursuing an investigation because the person involved declined to file a police report. \u2014 Did you see this? Indigenous delegates who have travelled to Rome to meet with Pope Francis are to get a private tour of the Vatican Museums today. The ethnological museum includes the Vatican\u2019s collection of Indigenous artifacts, some which have not been seen publicly. Indigenous curators and experts have said they have been unable to get access to the unknown number of objects in the Roman Catholic Church\u2019s possession. M\u00e9tis National Council president Cassidy Caron says she expects not only an apology \u2014 but access to the objects. She says they are important parts of M\u00e9tis history. The Vatican says parts of its collection were gifts to popes and the Catholic Church. In 2019, the Pope committed to putting many more objects on display, including those of Indigenous people. The collection in the Anima Mundi Ethnological Museum is known to contain masks, wampum belts, pipes and rugs, as well as other items from Indigenous communities in North America. Indigenous experts have said they don\u2019t have details of the items that have been identified or any idea of how many remain unknown. Many objects were taken after the Canadian government outlawed cultural practices through the Indian Act in 1876. Ceremonial items and other important objects were seized, then sold, given to museums or destroyed. \u2014 This report by The Canadian Press was first published March 29, 2022. The Canadian Press",

            "full_description": "In The News is a roundup of stories from The Canadian Press designed to kickstart your day. Here is what\u2019s on the radar of our editors for the morning of March 29 \u2026 What we are watching in Canada \u2026 Canada\u2019s families minister says upcoming childcare legislation will enshrine a long-term role for the federal government in the national daycare system. Karina Gould says the law would also include the principles provinces and territories signed onto in funding agreements, including cutting fees for parents and creating more spaces. Gould says her aim was to introduce a bill by this spring, but she now has until the end of the year as part of the confidence and supply agreement with the NDP. Federal officials have been quietly consulting experts on what should be in the law. The consultation document obtained by The Canadian Press says the legislation could commit to \u201congoing collaboration\u201d between the federal, provincial and territorial governments over the daycare system, including a pledge for \u201csustained federal funding.\u201d The paper also suggests annual public reports and a national advisory council could be included as part of \u201cvarious mechanisms\u201d to ensure federal accountability. \u2014 Also this \u2026 Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault will table a new greenhouse gas emissions plan in Parliament this morning. The plan is a legal requirement under the net-zero accountability law the Liberals passed last year. It will model emissions projections for different sectors that are feasible and necessary to achieve Canada\u2019s current goal to curb emissions to no more than 60 per cent of what they were in 2005 before the end of the decade. The plan was supposed to be tabled by the end of December but Guilbeault exercised a clause allowing him to ask for three more months. He says Canadians will see something in the plan they never have before: a road map to actually meet a climate target. Canada has issued at least 11 plans and set nine different emissions targets since 1988, but has never met a single one of them. \u2014 And this \u2026 The NDP says a promise to ban the use of replacement workers in lockouts and strikes at federally regulated workplaces is a \u201chuge win.\u201d The party\u2019s deputy labour critic, Matthew Green, says federal agreement to include the measure in a planned law was a key part of negotiating the recent confidence and supply deal with the Liberals. Unions have been calling for the change for decades \u2013 and are celebrating the news. But the Canadian Federation of Independent Business says any prolonged job action in critical federal infrastructure will hurt business owners across the country. A 2009 study shows so-called \u201canti-scab\u201d laws lead to more frequent strikes, but they aren\u2019t as long. Labour Minister Seamus O\u2019Regan says the government will be doing policy research and consultations before introducing the bill by the end of next year. \u2014 What we are watching in the U.S. \u2026 California\u2019s first-in-the-nation task force on reparations is at a crossroads, with members divided on which Black Americans should be eligible for compensation as atonement for a slave system that officially ended with the Civil War but reverberates to this day. Some members want to limit financial and other compensation to descendants of enslaved people while others say that all Black people in the U.S., regardless of lineage, suffer from systemic racism in housing, education and employment. The task force could vote on eligibility on Tuesday after putting it off last month. Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation creating the two-year reparations task force in 2020, making California the only state to move ahead with a study and plan, with a mission to study the institution of slavery and its harms and to educate the public about its findings. The committee is not even a year into its two-year process and there is no compensation plan of any kind on the table. But there is broad agreement among advocates of the need for multi-faceted remedies for related yet separate harms, such as slavery, Jim Crow laws, mass incarceration and redevelopment that resulted in displacement of Black communities. Compensation could include free college, assistance buying homes and launching businesses, and grants to churches and community organizations, advocates say. Yet, the eligibility question has dogged the group since its inaugural meeting in June, when viewers called in pleading with the nine-member group to devise targeted proposals and cash payments to make whole the descendants of people enslaved in the U.S. California Secretary of State Shirley Weber, who authored the legislation creating the task force, had argued passionately in January for prioritizing descendants for generations of forced labour, broken family ties and police terrorism. The daughter of sharecroppers forced to flee Arkansas in the dead of night, she recalled how the legacy of slavery broke her family and stunted their ability to dream of anything beyond survival. Opening up compensation to Black immigrants or even descendants of slaves from other countries would leave U.S. descendants with mere pennies, she said. \u2014 What we are watching in the rest of the world \u2026 LVIV, Ukraine _ Another round of talks aimed at stopping the war in Ukraine was scheduled for Tuesday as the fighting appeared stalemated on the ground, with the two sides trading control of a town in the east and a suburb of the capital. Ukrainian forces retook Irpin, northwest of Kyiv, from Russian troops, who were regrouping to take the area back, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said late Monday as he sought to rally the country. \u201cWe still have to fight, we have to endure,\u201d Zelenskyy said in his nighttime video address to the nation. \u201cWe can\u2019t express our emotions now. We can\u2019t raise expectations, simply so that we don\u2019t burn out.\u201d Ahead of the talks in Istanbul, the Ukrainian president said his country is prepared to declare its neutrality, as Moscow has demanded, in comments that might lend momentum to negotiations. Zelenskyy said over the weekend that compromise might be possible over \u201cthe complex issue of Donbas,\u201d the hotly contested region in the country\u2019s east. It\u2019s unclear how that might be reconciled with his stance that \u201cUkraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity are beyond doubt.\u201d Russia has long demanded that Ukraine drop any hope of joining NATO, which Moscow sees as a threat. Zelenskyy, for his part, has stressed that Ukraine needs security guarantees of its own as part of any deal. As fighting raged throughout the country, the mayor of Irpin, which has been the scene of some of the heaviest fighting, said the city had been \u201cliberated\u201d from Russian forces. A senior U.S. defence official said the U.S. believes the Ukrainians have also retaken the town of Trostyanets, south of Sumy, in the east. \u2014 On this day in 1848 \u2026 Niagara Falls stopped flowing for the only time in recorded history.

Zelenskyy said over the weekend that compromise might be possible over \u201cthe complex issue of Donbas,\u201d the hotly contested region in the country\u2019s east. It\u2019s unclear how that might be reconciled with his stance that \u201cUkraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity are beyond doubt.\u201d Russia has long demanded that Ukraine drop any hope of joining NATO, which Moscow sees as a threat. Zelenskyy, for his part, has stressed that Ukraine needs security guarantees of its own as part of any deal. As fighting raged throughout the country, the mayor of Irpin, which has been the scene of some of the heaviest fighting, said the city had been \u201cliberated\u201d from Russian forces. A senior U.S. defence official said the U.S. believes the Ukrainians have also retaken the town of Trostyanets, south of Sumy, in the east. \u2014 On this day in 1848 \u2026 Niagara Falls stopped flowing for the only time in recorded history.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences condemned Smith striking Rock, who had made a joke about his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, and said it would launch an inquiry. Later in the day, Smith gave a stronger apology than he did in his best actor acceptance speech, which notably hadn\u2019t included an apology to Rock. \u201cViolence in all of its forms is poisonous and destructive,\u201d said Smith in a statement issued by his publicist and posted on Instagram. \u201cMy behaviour at last night\u2019s Academy Awards was unacceptable and inexcusable. Jokes at my expense are a part of the job, but a joke about Jada\u2019s medical condition was too much for me to bear and I reacted emotionally. I would like to publicly apologize to you, Chris. I was out of line and I was wrong. I am embarrassed and my actions were not indicative of the man I want to be. There is no place for violence in a world of love and kindness.\u201d The 53-year-old actor added apologies to the film academy, producers of the telecast, attendees, viewers and the Williams family. Smith was honoured Sunday for his role as Richard Williams, father of Venus and Serena, in \u201cKing Richard.\u201d \u201cI am a work in progress,\u201d added Smith. After calling a board of governors meeting Monday to discuss the incident, the film academy said that it review Smith\u2019s actions and \u201cwill explore further action and consequences in accordance with our bylaws, standards of conduct and California law.\u201d The Los Angeles Police Department said Sunday it was aware of the incident but was not pursuing an investigation because the person involved declined to file a police report. \u2014 Did you see this? Indigenous delegates who have travelled to Rome to meet with Pope Francis are to get a private tour of the Vatican Museums today. The ethnological museum includes the Vatican\u2019s collection of Indigenous artifacts, some which have not been seen publicly. Indigenous curators and experts have said they have been unable to get access to the unknown number of objects in the Roman Catholic Church\u2019s possession. M\u00e9tis National Council president Cassidy Caron says she expects not only an apology \u2014 but access to the objects. She says they are important parts of M\u00e9tis history. The Vatican says parts of its collection were gifts to popes and the Catholic Church. In 2019, the Pope committed to putting many more objects on display, including those of Indigenous people. The collection in the Anima Mundi Ethnological Museum is known to contain masks, wampum belts, pipes and rugs, as well as other items from Indigenous communities in North America. Indigenous experts have said they don\u2019t have details of the items that have been identified or any idea of how many remain unknown. Many objects were taken after the Canadian government outlawed cultural practices through the Indian Act in 1876. Ceremonial items and other important objects were seized, then sold, given to museums or destroyed. \u2014 This report by The Canadian Press was first published March 29, 2022. The Canadian Press",

            "full_description": "In The News is a roundup of stories from The Canadian Press designed to kickstart your day. Here is what's on the radar of our editors for the morning of March 29 ... What we are watching in Canada ... Canada's families minister says upcoming childcare legislation will enshrine a long-term role for the federal government in the national daycare system. Karina Gould says the law would also include the principles provinces and territories signed onto in funding agreements, including cutting fees for parents and creating more spaces. Gould says her aim was to introduce a bill by this spring, but she now has until the end of the year as part of the confidence and supply agreement with the NDP. Federal officials have been quietly consulting experts on what should be in the law. The consultation document obtained by The Canadian Press says the legislation could commit to \"ongoing collaboration\" between the federal, provincial and territorial governments over the daycare system, including a pledge for \"sustained federal funding.\" The paper also suggests annual public reports and a national advisory council could be included as part of \"various mechanisms\" to ensure federal accountability. --- Also this ... Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault will table a new greenhouse gas emissions plan in Parliament this morning. The plan is a legal requirement under the net-zero accountability law the Liberals passed last year. It will model emissions projections for different sectors that are feasible and necessary to achieve Canada's current goal to curb emissions to no more than 60 per cent of what they were in 2005 before the end of the decade. The plan was supposed to be tabled by the end of December but Guilbeault exercised a clause allowing him to ask for three more months. He says Canadians will see something in the plan they never have before: a road map to actually meet a climate target. Canada has issued at least 11 plans and set nine different emissions targets since 1988, but has never met a single one of them. --- And this ... The NDP says a promise to ban the use of replacement workers in lockouts and strikes at federally regulated workplaces is a \u201chuge win.\u201d The party\u2019s deputy labour critic, Matthew Green, says federal agreement to include the measure in a planned law was a key part of negotiating the recent confidence and supply deal with the Liberals. Unions have been calling for the change for decades \u2013 and are celebrating the news. But the Canadian Federation of Independent Business says any prolonged job action in critical federal infrastructure will hurt business owners across the country. A 2009 study shows so-called \u201canti-scab\u201d laws lead to more frequent strikes, but they aren\u2019t as long. Labour Minister Seamus O\u2019Regan says the government will be doing policy research and consultations before introducing the bill by the end of next year. --- What we are watching in the U.S. ... California's first-in-the-nation task force on reparations is at a crossroads, with members divided on which Black Americans should be eligible for compensation as atonement for a slave system that officially ended with the Civil War but reverberates to this day. Some members want to limit financial and other compensation to descendants of enslaved people while others say that all Black people in the U.S., regardless of lineage, suffer from systemic racism in housing, education and employment. The task force could vote on eligibility on Tuesday after putting it off last month. Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation creating the two-year reparations task force in 2020, making California the only state to move ahead with a study and plan, with a mission to study the institution of slavery and its harms and to educate the public about its findings. The committee is not even a year into its two-year process and there is no compensation plan of any kind on the table. But there is broad agreement among advocates of the need for multi-faceted remedies for related yet separate harms, such as slavery, Jim Crow laws, mass incarceration and redevelopment that resulted in displacement of Black communities. Compensation could include free college, assistance buying homes and launching businesses, and grants to churches and community organizations, advocates say. Yet, the eligibility question has dogged the group since its inaugural meeting in June, when viewers called in pleading with the nine-member group to devise targeted proposals and cash payments to make whole the descendants of people enslaved in the U.S. California Secretary of State Shirley Weber, who authored the legislation creating the task force, had argued passionately in January for prioritizing descendants for generations of forced labour, broken family ties and police terrorism. The daughter of sharecroppers forced to flee Arkansas in the dead of night, she recalled how the legacy of slavery broke her family and stunted their ability to dream of anything beyond survival. Opening up compensation to Black immigrants or even descendants of slaves from other countries would leave U.S. descendants with mere pennies, she said. --- What we are watching in the rest of the world ... LVIV, Ukraine _ Another round of talks aimed at stopping the war in Ukraine was scheduled for Tuesday as the fighting appeared stalemated on the ground, with the two sides trading control of a town in the east and a suburb of the capital.

California's first-in-the-nation task force on reparations is at a crossroads, with members divided on which Black Americans should be eligible for compensation as atonement for a slave system that officially ended with the Civil War but reverberates to this day. Some members want to limit financial and other compensation to descendants of enslaved people while others say that all Black people in the U.S., regardless of lineage, suffer from systemic racism in housing, education and employment. The task force could vote on eligibility on Tuesday after putting it off last month. Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation creating the two-year reparations task force in 2020, making California the only state to move ahead with a study and plan, with a mission to study the institution of slavery and its harms and to educate the public about its findings. The committee is not even a year into its two-year process and there is no compensation plan of any kind on the table. But there is broad agreement among advocates of the need for multi-faceted remedies for related yet separate harms, such as slavery, Jim Crow laws, mass incarceration and redevelopment that resulted in displacement of Black communities. Compensation could include free college, assistance buying homes and launching businesses, and grants to churches and community organizations, advocates say. Yet, the eligibility question has dogged the group since its inaugural meeting in June, when viewers called in pleading with the nine-member group to devise targeted proposals and cash payments to make whole the descendants of people enslaved in the U.S. California Secretary of State Shirley Weber, who authored the legislation creating the task force, had argued passionately in January for prioritizing descendants for generations of forced labour, broken family ties and police terrorism. The daughter of sharecroppers forced to flee Arkansas in the dead of night, she recalled how the legacy of slavery broke her family and stunted their ability to dream of anything beyond survival. Opening up compensation to Black immigrants or even descendants of slaves from other countries would leave U.S. descendants with mere pennies, she said. --- What we are watching in the rest of the world ... LVIV, Ukraine _ Another round of talks aimed at stopping the war in Ukraine was scheduled for Tuesday as the fighting appeared stalemated on the ground, with the two sides trading control of a town in the east and a suburb of the capital. Ukrainian forces retook Irpin, northwest of Kyiv, from Russian troops, who were regrouping to take the area back, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said late Monday as he sought to rally the country. \"We still have to fight, we have to endure,'' Zelenskyy said in his nighttime video address to the nation. ``We can't express our emotions now. We can't raise expectations, simply so that we don't burn out.'' Ahead of the talks in Istanbul, the Ukrainian president said his country is prepared to declare its neutrality, as Moscow has demanded, in comments that might lend momentum to negotiations. Zelenskyy said over the weekend that compromise might be possible over \"the complex issue of Donbas,'' the hotly contested region in the country's east. It's unclear how that might be reconciled with his stance that \"Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity are beyond doubt.'' Russia has long demanded that Ukraine drop any hope of joining NATO, which Moscow sees as a threat. Zelenskyy, for his part, has stressed that Ukraine needs security guarantees of its own as part of any deal. As fighting raged throughout the country, the mayor of Irpin, which has been the scene of some of the heaviest fighting, said the city had been \"liberated'' from Russian forces. A senior U.S. defence official said the U.S. believes the Ukrainians have also retaken the town of Trostyanets, south of Sumy, in the east. --- On this day in 1848 ...

LOS ANGELES _ The day after slapping Chris Rock on the Oscars stage and upending the 94th Academy Awards, Will Smith issued an apology to the comedian, to the academy and to viewers at home, saying he was \"out of line'' and that his actions are \"not indicative of the man I want to be.'' The fallout from Smith's actions during Sunday's ceremony continued Monday as Hollywood and the public continued to wrestle with a moment that stunned the Dolby Theatre crowd and viewers at home. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences condemned Smith striking Rock, who had made a joke about his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, and said it would launch an inquiry. Later in the day, Smith gave a stronger apology than he did in his best actor acceptance speech, which notably hadn't included an apology to Rock. \"Violence in all of its forms is poisonous and destructive,'' said Smith in a statement issued by his publicist and posted on Instagram. \"My behaviour at last night's Academy Awards was unacceptable and inexcusable. Jokes at my expense are a part of the job, but a joke about Jada's medical condition was too much for me to bear and I reacted emotionally. I would like to publicly apologize to you, Chris. I was out of line and I was wrong. I am embarrassed and my actions were not indicative of the man I want to be. There is no place for violence in a world of love and kindness.'' The 53-year-old actor added apologies to the film academy, producers of the telecast, attendees, viewers and the Williams family. Smith was honoured Sunday for his role as Richard Williams, father of Venus and Serena, in \"King Richard.'' \"I am a work in progress,'' added Smith. After calling a board of governors meeting Monday to discuss the incident, the film academy said that it review Smith's actions and ``will explore further action and consequences in accordance with our bylaws, standards of conduct and California law.'' The Los Angeles Police Department said Sunday it was aware of the incident but was not pursuing an investigation because the person involved declined to file a police report. --- Did you see this? Indigenous delegates who have travelled to Rome to meet with Pope Francis are to get a private tour of the Vatican Museums today. The ethnological museum includes the Vatican\u2019s collection of Indigenous artifacts, some which have not been seen publicly. Indigenous curators and experts have said they have been unable to get access to the unknown number of objects in the Roman Catholic Church\u2019s possession. M\u00e9tis National Council president Cassidy Caron says she expects not only an apology \u2014 but access to the objects. She says they are important parts of M\u00e9tis history. The Vatican says parts of its collection were gifts to popes and the Catholic Church. In 2019, the Pope committed to putting many more objects on display, including those of Indigenous people. The collection in the Anima Mundi Ethnological Museum is known to contain masks, wampum belts, pipes and rugs, as well as other items from Indigenous communities in North America. Indigenous experts have said they don\u2019t have details of the items that have been identified or any idea of how many remain unknown. Many objects were taken after the Canadian government outlawed cultural practices through the Indian Act in 1876.

What we are watching in Canada ... Canada's families minister says upcoming childcare legislation will enshrine a long-term role for the federal government in the national daycare system. Karina Gould says the law would also include the principles provinces and territories signed onto in funding agreements, including cutting fees for parents and creating more spaces. Gould says her aim was to introduce a bill by this spring, but she now has until the end of the year as part of the confidence and supply agreement with the NDP. Federal officials have been quietly consulting experts on what should be in the law. The consultation document obtained by The Canadian Press says the legislation could commit to \"ongoing collaboration\" between the federal, provincial and territorial governments over the daycare system, including a pledge for \"sustained federal funding.\" The paper also suggests annual public reports and a national advisory council could be included as part of \"various mechanisms\" to ensure federal accountability. --- Also this ... Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault will table a new greenhouse gas emissions plan in Parliament this morning. The plan is a legal requirement under the net-zero accountability law the Liberals passed last year. It will model emissions projections for different sectors that are feasible and necessary to achieve Canada's current goal to curb emissions to no more than 60 per cent of what they were in 2005 before the end of the decade. The plan was supposed to be tabled by the end of December but Guilbeault exercised a clause allowing him to ask for three more months.

            "full_description": "In The News is a roundup of stories from The Canadian Press designed to kickstart your day. Here is what's on the radar of our editors for the morning of March 29 ... What we are watching in Canada ... Canada's families minister says upcoming childcare legislation will enshrine a long-term role for the federal government in the national daycare system. Karina Gould says the law would also include the principles provinces and territories signed onto in funding agreements, including cutting fees for parents and creating more spaces. Gould says her aim was to introduce a bill by this spring, but she now has until the end of the year as part of the confidence and supply agreement with the NDP. Federal officials have been quietly consulting experts on what should be in the law. The consultation document obtained by The Canadian Press says the legislation could commit to \"ongoing collaboration\" between the federal, provincial and territorial governments over the daycare system, including a pledge for \"sustained federal funding.\" The paper also suggests annual public reports and a national advisory council could be included as part of \"various mechanisms\" to ensure federal accountability. --- Also this ... Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault will table a new greenhouse gas emissions plan in Parliament this morning. The plan is a legal requirement under the net-zero accountability law the Liberals passed last year. It will model emissions projections for different sectors that are feasible and necessary to achieve Canada's current goal to curb emissions to no more than 60 per cent of what they were in 2005 before the end of the decade. The plan was supposed to be tabled by the end of December but Guilbeault exercised a clause allowing him to ask for three more months. He says Canadians will see something in the plan they never have before: a road map to actually meet a climate target. Canada has issued at least 11 plans and set nine different emissions targets since 1988, but has never met a single one of them. --- And this ... The NDP says a promise to ban the use of replacement workers in lockouts and strikes at federally regulated workplaces is a \u201chuge win.\u201d The party\u2019s deputy labour critic, Matthew Green, says federal agreement to include the measure in a planned law was a key part of negotiating the recent confidence and supply deal with the Liberals. Unions have been calling for the change for decades \u2013 and are celebrating the news. But the Canadian Federation of Independent Business says any prolonged job action in critical federal infrastructure will hurt business owners across the country. A 2009 study shows so-called \u201canti-scab\u201d laws lead to more frequent strikes, but they aren\u2019t as long. Labour Minister Seamus O\u2019Regan says the government will be doing policy research and consultations before introducing the bill by the end of next year. --- What we are watching in the U.S. ... California's first-in-the-nation task force on reparations is at a crossroads, with members divided on which Black Americans should be eligible for compensation as atonement for a slave system that officially ended with the Civil War but reverberates to this day. Some members want to limit financial and other compensation to descendants of enslaved people while others say that all Black people in the U.S., regardless of lineage, suffer from systemic racism in housing, education and employment. The task force could vote on eligibility on Tuesday after putting it off last month. Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation creating the two-year reparations task force in 2020, making California the only state to move ahead with a study and plan, with a mission to study the institution of slavery and its harms and to educate the public about its findings. The committee is not even a year into its two-year process and there is no compensation plan of any kind on the table. But there is broad agreement among advocates of the need for multi-faceted remedies for related yet separate harms, such as slavery, Jim Crow laws, mass incarceration and redevelopment that resulted in displacement of Black communities. Compensation could include free college, assistance buying homes and launching businesses, and grants to churches and community organizations, advocates say. Yet, the eligibility question has dogged the group since its inaugural meeting in June, when viewers called in pleading with the nine-member group to devise targeted proposals and cash payments to make whole the descendants of people enslaved in the U.S. California Secretary of State Shirley Weber, who authored the legislation creating the task force, had argued passionately in January for prioritizing descendants for generations of forced labour, broken family ties and police terrorism. The daughter of sharecroppers forced to flee Arkansas in the dead of night, she recalled how the legacy of slavery broke her family and stunted their ability to dream of anything beyond survival. Opening up compensation to Black immigrants or even descendants of slaves from other countries would leave U.S. descendants with mere pennies, she said. --- What we are watching in the rest of the world ... LVIV, Ukraine _ Another round of talks aimed at stopping the war in Ukraine was scheduled for Tuesday as the fighting appeared stalemated on the ground, with the two sides trading control of a town in the east and a suburb of the capital. Ukrainian forces retook Irpin, northwest of Kyiv, from Russian troops, who were regrouping to take the area back, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said late Monday as he sought to rally the country. \"We still have to fight, we have to endure,'' Zelenskyy said in his nighttime video address to the nation. ``We can't express our emotions now. We can't raise expectations, simply so that we don't burn out.'' Ahead of the talks in Istanbul, the Ukrainian president said his country is prepared to declare its neutrality, as Moscow has demanded, in comments that might lend momentum to negotiations. Zelenskyy said over the weekend that compromise might be possible over \"the complex issue of Donbas,'' the hotly contested region in the country's east. It's unclear how that might be reconciled with his stance that \"Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity are beyond doubt.'' Russia has long demanded that Ukraine drop any hope of joining NATO, which Moscow sees as a threat. Zelenskyy, for his part, has stressed that Ukraine needs security guarantees of its own as part of any deal. As fighting raged throughout the country, the mayor of Irpin, which has been the scene of some of the heaviest fighting, said the city had been \"liberated'' from Russian forces. A senior U.S. defence official said the U.S. believes the Ukrainians have also retaken the town of Trostyanets, south of Sumy, in the east. --- On this day in 1848 ... Niagara Falls stopped flowing for the only time in recorded history. The flow was blocked for 30 hours by an ice jam at the Lake Erie entrance to the Niagara River. --- In entertainment ... LOS ANGELES _ The day after slapping Chris Rock on the Oscars stage and upending the 94th Academy Awards, Will Smith issued an apology to the comedian, to the academy and to viewers at home, saying he was \"out of line'' and that his actions are \"not indicative of the man I want to be.'' The fallout from Smith's actions during Sunday's ceremony continued Monday as Hollywood and the public continued to wrestle with a moment that stunned the Dolby Theatre crowd and viewers at home. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences condemned Smith striking Rock, who had made a joke about his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, and said it would launch an inquiry. Later in the day, Smith gave a stronger apology than he did in his best actor acceptance speech, which notably hadn't included an apology to Rock. \"Violence in all of its forms is poisonous and destructive,'' said Smith in a statement issued by his publicist and posted on Instagram. \"My behaviour at last night's Academy Awards was unacceptable and inexcusable. Jokes at my expense are a part of the job, but a joke about Jada's medical condition was too much for me to bear and I reacted emotionally. I would like to publicly apologize to you, Chris. I was out of line and I was wrong. I am embarrassed and my actions were not indicative of the man I want to be. There is no place for violence in a world of love and kindness.'' The 53-year-old actor added apologies to the film academy, producers of the telecast, attendees, viewers and the Williams family. Smith was honoured Sunday for his role as Richard Williams, father of Venus and Serena, in \"King Richard.'' \"I am a work in progress,'' added Smith. After calling a board of governors meeting Monday to discuss the incident, the film academy said that it review Smith's actions and ``will explore further action and consequences in accordance with our bylaws, standards of conduct and California law.'' The Los Angeles Police Department said Sunday it was aware of the incident but was not pursuing an investigation because the person involved declined to file a police report. --- Did you see this? Indigenous delegates who have travelled to Rome to meet with Pope Francis are to get a private tour of the Vatican Museums today. The ethnological museum includes the Vatican\u2019s collection of Indigenous artifacts, some which have not been seen publicly. Indigenous curators and experts have said they have been unable to get access to the unknown number of objects in the Roman Catholic Church\u2019s possession. M\u00e9tis National Council president Cassidy Caron says she expects not only an apology \u2014 but access to the objects. She says they are important parts of M\u00e9tis history. The Vatican says parts of its collection were gifts to popes and the Catholic Church. In 2019, the Pope committed to putting many more objects on display, including those of Indigenous people. The collection in the Anima Mundi Ethnological Museum is known to contain masks, wampum belts, pipes and rugs, as well as other items from Indigenous communities in North America. Indigenous experts have said they don\u2019t have details of the items that have been identified or any idea of how many remain unknown. Many objects were taken after the Canadian government outlawed cultural practices through the Indian Act in 1876. Ceremonial items and other important objects were seized, then sold, given to museums or destroyed. --- This report by The Canadian Press was first published March 29, 2022. The Canadian Press",

            "description": "Severe storms that washed out southern Interior highways and flooded the Lower Mainland, heat domes and forest fires are all signs of climate change. But, on the far side of B.C., high up in a Rocky Mountain pass, the melting glaciers mean that a century-old rock cabin and national historic site that straddles the Continental Divide will be demolished this summer. The Abbot Pass Refuge Cabin was built in 1922 by Swiss-born pioneering mountaineers but the glacier that held it at the top of a ridge between Lake O\u2019Hara in Yoho National Park and Lake Louise has melted, undermining its foundation and making it difficult to even remove it safely. \u201cThere was a burgeoning tourist industry in the Lake Louise area so, along the railway, they were putting up huts and houses and hotels and they were trying to bring people into western Canada to develop it as a tourist area,\u201d Keith Sanford, interim executive director of the Alpine Club of Canada, told iNFOnews.ca. Abbott Pass is 2,926 above sea level and lies between Mount Lefroy and Mount Victoria, two popular mountain climbing areas. READ MORE: iN PHOTOS: Racers try to finish this 1,000-km KVR trail ride from Merritt to Fernie in 3 days \u201cTo access that pass from the railway was a considerable undertaking for anybody so they put a hut there so you wouldn\u2019t have to carry so much,\u201d Sanford said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have super lightweight tents and sleeping bags and all the rest of it.\u201d The two-storey stone cabin sleeps 10 to 15 people and is about 30-feet long, Sanford said. It was acquired by Parks Canada in 1968, restored in 1973 and declared a national historic site in 1992. In 1985, the Alpine Club of Canada, which was founded in 1906, took over operation of the hut and, until recently, rented it out to visitors. \u201cIt\u2019s the oldest of all of our huts we operated so it\u2019s got a ton of history,\u201d Sanford said. \u201cPeople have died up there. People have got married up there. It\u2019s really an interesting spot.\u201d Those who have visited the hut include hundreds of students from Okanagan Mission Secondary School in Kelowna who have been hiking into Lake O\u2019Hara in Glacier National Park almost every fall since 1977. \u201cOur students haven't travelled to the hut in several years due to the rocky scramble to get up there using helmets and additional gear,\u201d Rick Gandha, one of the most recent teachers at the school to organize the hike, told iNFOnews.ca in an email. \u201cWe do hike to Oesa Lake at Lake O'Hara and we view the hut from a distance and talk about its history and relevance.\u201d Parks Canada is no longer honouring its relationship with the school so the Lake O\u2019Hara hikes are no longer possible, he said. The area approaching the cabin has been closed to the public since 2018. That was after Parks Canada did extensive repairs to the building in 2012 and 2014. Slope instability was first noticed in 2016. Parks Canada spent $600,000 in 2018 trying to shore up the foundation. That failed in the end because the ridge it sits on is fractured bedrock along with \u201csoil and rock bound with ice,\u201d not bedrock, Parks Canada said. Weather conditions in 2019, and COVID in 2020, prevented any further work on the slope. By last year it was determined that the cabin could not be saved, even if work had been done during those two summers. There had been discussions on trying to dismantle the cabin and rebuild it elsewhere but it\u2019s built of limestone and held together with mortar. Dismantling, therefore, is deemed impossible, even if it was safe to do so in that location. Sanford doesn\u2019t know how crews will even be able to safely dismantle it. \u201cObviously, you can take a sledge hammer to it but you might fall over the edge doing it and kill yourself,\u201d he said, not at all in jest. In fact, while hiking to view the cabin from Lake O\u2019Hara can take about four hours, the last few hundred metres are very steep and rubble-strewn. There\u2019s another route along a series of ledges that can only be managed by experienced climbers who know where to go. There are ropes and cables along some of the ledges, Sanford said. \u201cI\u2019ve done both routes a few times but it\u2019s not something you do for an afternoon walk,\u201d Sanford said. Going down into Lake Louise from the cabin is not advised. \u201cYou can\u2019t go down from the hut because you\u2019re on a glacier into what\u2019s called The Death Trap and it routinely takes ice and snowfall off the north side of Mt. Victoria and, it is a death trap,\u201d Sanford said. \u201cIt\u2019s not recommended to go in there. Ever.\u201d Discussions are still underway on how or what to construct as a memorial to the hut.

That failed in the end because the ridge it sits on is fractured bedrock along with \u201csoil and rock bound with ice,\u201d not bedrock, Parks Canada said. Weather conditions in 2019, and COVID in 2020, prevented any further work on the slope. By last year it was determined that the cabin could not be saved, even if work had been done during those two summers. There had been discussions on trying to dismantle the cabin and rebuild it elsewhere but it\u2019s built of limestone and held together with mortar. Dismantling, therefore, is deemed impossible, even if it was safe to do so in that location. Sanford doesn\u2019t know how crews will even be able to safely dismantle it. \u201cObviously, you can take a sledge hammer to it but you might fall over the edge doing it and kill yourself,\u201d he said, not at all in jest. In fact, while hiking to view the cabin from Lake O\u2019Hara can take about four hours, the last few hundred metres are very steep and rubble-strewn. There\u2019s another route along a series of ledges that can only be managed by experienced climbers who know where to go. There are ropes and cables along some of the ledges, Sanford said. \u201cI\u2019ve done both routes a few times but it\u2019s not something you do for an afternoon walk,\u201d Sanford said. Going down into Lake Louise from the cabin is not advised. \u201cYou can\u2019t go down from the hut because you\u2019re on a glacier into what\u2019s called The Death Trap and it routinely takes ice and snowfall off the north side of Mt. Victoria and, it is a death trap,\u201d Sanford said. \u201cIt\u2019s not recommended to go in there. Ever.\u201d Discussions are still underway on how or what to construct as a memorial to the hut.

Photo taken in February Nathan Cook, Author providedIt\u2019s official: the Great Barrier Reef is suffering its fourth mass bleaching event since 2016. We dived into the reef yesterday and saw the unfolding crisis firsthand. Descending beneath the surface at John Brewer Reef near Townsville, our eyes were immediately drawn to the iridescent whites, blues and pinks of stressed corals among the deeper browns, reds and greens of healthier colonies. It\u2019s a depressing, but all-too-familiar feeling. A sense of: \u201chere we go again\u201d This is the first time the reef has bleached under the cooling conditions of the natural La Ni\u00f1a weather pattern, which shows just how strong the long-term warming trend of climate change is. Despite the cooling conditions, 2021 was one of the hottest years on record. When coral bleaches, it is not dead \u2013 yet. Coral reefs that suffer widespread bleaching can still recover if conditions improve, but it\u2019s estimated to take up to 12 years. That is, if there\u2019s no new disturbance in the meantime, such as a cyclone or another bleaching event. So what conditions are needed for coral recovery? And under what conditions will coral die? Bleaching at John Brewer Reef, near Townsville. Harriet Spark/Grumpy Turtle, Author provided What it takes for coral to die Whether a coral can survive bleaching depends on how long conditions remain stressful, and to what level. What\u2019s more, some species are more sensitive than others, such as branching acropora corals, especially if they\u2019ve bleached previously. If water remains too warm for too long, corals will eventually die. But if the water temperature drops and the ultraviolet light becomes less intense, then the coral may recover and survive. While the average sea temperatures in the reef currently remain above average, they\u2019ve shown signs of cooling to a more amenable average for coral survival. Bleaching at John Brewer Reef. Nathan Cook, Author provided Sea temperatures in Cleveland Bay, near Townsville, were above 31\u2103 in early March, but thankfully have now reduced to below 29\u2103. Similarly in the Whitsundays, Hardy Reef experienced temperatures as high as 30\u2103 but has receded to nearer 26\u2103 in the past few weeks. If coral does survives a bleaching event, it is still impacted physiologically, as bleaching can slow growth rates and reduce reproductive capacity. Surviving colonies also become more susceptible to other challenges, such as disease. Signs of stress Survival also depends on each individual coral\u2019s own resilience: its ability to cope with higher temperatures and increased ultraviolet stress. For example, fast growing branching corals are the most susceptible to bleaching and are generally the first to die. Long-lived massive corals, such as porites, may be less susceptible to bleaching, show minimal effects of bleaching and recover quicker. White and fluorescent corals are currently a common sight on many reefs. Harriet Spark/Grumpy Turtle, Author provided Corals can use fluorescent pigments to shield themselves from excessive ultraviolet radiation \u2013 a bit like sunscreen that lets coral manage, filter and attempt to regulate the incoming light. To the casual observer, fluorescent corals look bright purple, pink, blue and yellow. For reef scientists, fluorescence is an obvious signal that corals are stressed and struggling to regulate their internal balance. As we\u2019ve seen, white and fluorescent corals are currently a common sight on many reefs. \u00c0 lire aussi : Adapt, move, or die: repeated coral bleaching leaves wildlife on the Great Barrier Reef with few options Most coral species have fluorescent pigments in their tissue. Some are always visible to humans, especially branching corals with bright blue or pink hues on the their branch tips. Others are never visible, and some are visible only during times of heat stress when coral colonies boost these fluorescent pigments to fight the increasing ultraviolet intensity in warmer seas. Bleaching can slow coral growth rates and reduce reproduction. Harriet Spark/Grumpy Turtle, Author provided Coral can\u2019t adapt fast enough Scientists measure heat stress on corals using a metric called \u201cdegree heating weeks\u201d. One degree heating week is when the temperature at a given location is more than 1\u2103 over the historical maximum temperature. If the water is 2\u2103 above the historical maximum for one week, this would be considered two degree heating weeks. Generally speaking, at four degree heating weeks, scientists expect to see signs of stress and coral bleaching. It usually takes eight degree heating weeks for coral to die. According to Bureau of Meteorology data, many parts of the Great Barrier Reef, such as off Cairns and Port Douglas, currently remain in the window of between four and eight degree heating weeks. But some areas, near Townsville and the Whitsundays, are experiencing severe bleaching stress beyond eight degree heating weeks. While we hope many coral reefs will recover from this round of bleaching, the long term implications cannot be understated. When corals bleach, they eject their zooxanthellae \u2013 single-celled algae that gives coral colour and energy. Some corals may regain their zooxanthellae after the bleaching event is over, but this usually takes between three and six months. \u00c0 lire aussi : No, sunscreen chemicals are not bleaching the Great Barrier Reef To make matters worse, full reef recovery requires no new bleaching events or other disturbances in the years that follow. Given the reef has bleached six times since the late 1990s, alongside global climate trajectories, this would appear an unlikely scenario. While some corals may learn to cope with these new conditions by potentially acquiring more heat-tolerant zooxanthellae, the reality is that change is happening too fast for coral to adapt via evolution. The severe bleaching in previous years also means future events may appear less severe. But this is simply because most of the heat sensitive corals have already died, potentially resulting in a lower probability of widespread severe bleaching. Any policy without action on climate change is ineffective. Harriet Spark/Grumpy Turtle, Author provided We need stronger climate policies and action Australia has the world\u2019s best marine scientists and marine park managers. And yet, our policies are rated \u201chighly insufficient\u201d, according to the latest Climate Action Tracker. If global emissions continue unabated, Australia may warm by 4\u2103 or more this century. Under this scenario, widespread coral bleaching is likely on the Great Barrier Reef every year from 2044 onward. There has been some glimmers of hope in federal policy in recent years, such as statements recognising the existential threat climate change poses to coral reefs. Despite this recognition, substantial action is lacking, as any policy without action on climate change is ineffective. If the federal government, reef businesses and individuals are to show leadership and maintain healthy reefs, we need to work together and take rapid, drastic action to reduce carbon emissions. Committing to a stronger emissions target for 2030 and a carbon neutral footprint for all Great Barrier Reef businesses would go a long way to exhibiting the kind of change required if coral reefs, in their current form, are to survive into the future. \u00c0 lire aussi : Climate change has already hit Australia.

            "full_description": "Dyson, makers of vacuum cleaners with dirt-seeking lasers , has created a set of air-purifying headphones which are apparently not an April Fool's joke. According to the Dyson Zone product page , the device's mouth visor is meant to channel \"a continuous stream of purified air to your nose and mouth, without touching your face.\" We don't have any specs on the headphones themselves; all we know is that they are Bluetooth and noise canceling. The team over at Stuff was able to wear the mask and give the headphones a listen and said it was possible to hear the hums of the air purification motors in the ear cups even with noise-canceling enabled, which seems like an obvious downside to wearing an air purifier on your head. Dyson has said a lot about how great its mask is for delivering clean air to your lungs, but it should be noted that air purifiers are \"not enough to protect people from Covid-19,\" according to the EPA . The agency is obviously not referring to wearable air purifiers used outside the house (because the Dyzon Zone did not exist when it made its recommendation), but it is easy enough to see that if someone is sick and wearing this mask, they can still spread airborne germs. There's no seal like there is on KN95 or N95 masks . The filtering is only one-way, and according to Dyson, it acts on \"city fumes and pollutants.\" You have to wonder if blowing air at people's faces is a great idea at a time when we're attempting to limit the circulation of a virus. In one of the publicity shots, the mask is being worn on a train, leaving the nose exposed\u2014not exactly what the MTA would recommend. Insert quote here Get in the zone with Dyson\u2019s latest technology. 30 years of air filtration expertise pioneered into a wearable, high-end audio device. With a contact-free visor to supply a continuous stream of purified air to your nose and mouth. So, you can breathe cleaner air, anywhere. March 30, 2022 Dyson says that work on the mask started pre-pandemic and that it's working on an aerosol filtering mask that will somehow fit the Dyson Zone. So, a mask designed to reduce transmission of Covid to wear with your other mask that reduces pollutants. That seems like too many masks. It's tough to nail down who this mask is actually for. While air pollution is a serious concern, I think I'll just stick with my black N95 when I take the bus into the city. Though for the sake of journalism, I'm confident our own Dave James wouldn't mind wearing these around town like he did the Razer Zephyr . The Dyson Zone air-purifying headphones will be available online at Dyson.com later this year. No price has been listed yet.

The only problem is that you could end up looking like Bane, the Batman villain portrayed by actor Tom Hardy in the 2012 film \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises.\u201d Dyson\u2019s dork looking new product, could end up only being sold at the Companies store in Australia, with retailers telling ChannelNews that they are not happy with Dyson\u2019s decision to open a new direct sell store in Sydney. Described as the largest trading retail space of any Dyson store across Asia and Australasia the George Street store has angered senior management at several big retailers who have helped the Company grow their brand in Australia. Dyson claim that their new \u201cDyson Zone\u201d offering has been six years in the making and that they developed more than 500 prototypes before deciding on the final version that was revealed to the media last night. \u201cThe result of over a decade of air quality research and development, the Dyson Zone air-purifying headphones simultaneously tackle the urban issues of air quality and noise pollution,\u201d Dyson said in a release. The headset\u2019s strange look drew immediate attention among social media users \u2013 many of whom pointed out that it resembled the mask worn by Batman\u2019s Bane. The product was immediately mocked on social media. \u201cThe Dyson Bane, coming soon to an affluent/gullible High Street near you,\u201d one Twitter user joked. \u201cI mean, we could just clean up air pollution in cities, but no, let\u2019s all just cosplay Blade Runner instead,\u201d another quipped. Others joked that the device seemed like an elaborate April Fool\u2019s Day joke \u2014 which Dyson quickly denied. The latest Dyson offering is a set of large, plush headphones with a plastic mask-type contraption that connects from ear-to-ear across the wearer\u2019s mouth that will generate interest if not finer pointing. \u201cIt could even scare off kids\u201d one person said. It delivers purified air to the mouth and nose while simultaneously tackling noise pollution through its active noise cancelling technology. Chief engineer Jake Dyson said: \u201cAir pollution is a global problem \u2013 it affects us everywhere we go. In our homes, at school, at work and as we travel, whether on foot, on a bike or by public or private transport. The Dyson Zone purifies the air you breathe on the move. And unlike face masks, it delivers a plume of fresh air without touching your face.\u201d Dyson said the distinctive visor is \u201cnon-contact\u201d and \u201ckept near the nose and mouth\u201d rather than fully masking them. The device works through compressors contained in each ear cup, which work to \u201cproject two streams of purified air to the wearer\u2019s nose and mouth\u201d through the visor The \u201cZone\u201d is capable of filtering up to 99% of particle pollution, Dyson claims. Known for their high staff churn in Australia, Dyson management have not said when the new product will be available in Australia.",

            "description": "A global treaty on plastic pollution must incentivize a make-take-reuse waste management system and include quantitative targets based on geography-specific emissions.",
            "full_description": "Plastic pollution is a global problem , contaminating terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems . Microplastics \u2014 plastic particles smaller than five millimetres in size \u2014 infiltrate and circulate in the global planetary dust cycle , water cycle and carbon cycle . Microplastics have infiltrated the food and water we consume and the air we breathe. These tiny plastic particles can harm wildlife populations and communities, threatening the ecological balance. A new paper suggests plastics are a planetary boundary threat and that we are outside the safe operating space. In early March, after years of negotiations, delegates from 175 nations committed to draft the first global treaty on plastic pollution at the UN Environment Assembly in Nairobi. This resolution comes 30 years after the creation of the first global treaty to address climate change in 1992, which recognized there was a problem with greenhouse gases but did not include quantitative global targets until the Kyoto Protocol in 2005. As researchers studying plastic pollution and working at the science-policy interface , we believe there is enough evidence regarding contamination and the effects of plastic pollution to see that the first treaty on plastic needs to include quantitative targets and binding measures that facilitate a circular economy \u2014 a system that focuses on reusing and reducing plastic waste. As with climate change, the urgency to find a solution to plastic pollution is clear. Trends show an increasing trajectory for plastic emissions \u2014 plastic emitted into the environment \u2014 just as they do for greenhouse gas emissions . In 2021, we estimated that around 30 million tonnes of plastic waste was emitted into freshwater and marine ecosystems. If we continue business as usual, that number could increase more than two-fold by the end of this decade. In 2017, we called for a global treaty to facilitate collaboration on this global issue, and in 2020 a systemic shift in the plastics economy \u2014 bending our current linear plastic economy (make-take-waste) into a circular economy (make-take-reuse), fundamentally changing the way we use plastic materials to minimize waste. A global treaty on plastic must have a circular economy at its core. It should also set global targets for reducing plastic emissions akin to the Paris Agreement for carbon emissions. To facilitate success, the treaty should include global mechanisms that incentivize a circular economy, methods for reporting plastic emissions at the local and national level and resources that aid economies in measuring and reducing these emissions. To measurably reduce plastic emissions, we envision a global treaty where countries sign on as signatories with a defined reduction target. For example, each country might agree to reduce 40 per cent of its emissions by 2030 from base-year levels. To facilitate a circular economy, there needs to be a global cap on virgin plastic production, recycled content standards or a shift from incentives for virgin plastic to incentives for post-consumer recycled plastic. Each country needs to come up with a strategy to meet reduction targets. Because there is no one-size-fits-all solution, each country may take on its own set of unique solutions to reach its target. For example, countries may adopt container deposit schemes to increase recycling rates, eliminate the use of single-use plastic items like plastic bags and straws that are not essential and do not fit into a circular economy, improve waste collection and management infrastructure, and agree to market only plastics that are either recyclable or reusable in their region, if not both. Each year countries must report their plastic emissions to a body like the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as part of this treaty. Determining baseline emissions, setting reduction targets and tracking our progress towards meeting those targets require formal accounting. Here, another tool we can borrow from climate policy is the emissions inventory , which accounts for the total amount of emissions that originates from relevant sources within cities, provinces, states or countries. Emissions inventories help prioritize the reduction of emissions from the largest sources within a given region and are necessary to accurately check the effectiveness of solutions. Emissions inventories will quantify progress, identify leaders and laggards and document the success of our transition to a circular economy. For some countries, aid will be necessary to build new infrastructure for reducing plastic pollution. These countries need access to a global fund, similar to the UNFCCC\u2019s climate fund . To build this fund, an extended producer responsibility program \u2014 a materials management program funded by those who make plastics \u2014 can be implemented. For example, if a fund pulled in $0.01 for every pound of virgin plastic produced, it would have equated to $8 billion per year in 2020. For plastic pollution, the phrase \u201cthere is no time to waste\u201d is not just clever, it is spot on. As we negotiate how we will end plastic pollution, the problem continues to grow. We cannot wait another decade to establish baselines, reduction targets and thresholds for the safety of our environment and human health. We are optimistic about the recent resolution to draft a global treaty on plastic pollution and thrilled that Canada aims to be a leader in its creation and actions necessary to make positive change. International governments have provided an opportunity for systemic change, so let us make the most of it and develop a global treaty with quantitative targets and binding resolutions that measurably reduce our production of plastic waste and pollution.

            "content": "The European Union has announced a new bundle of sustainability-focused policy proposals that will expand existing ecodesign rules on energy efficiency by encouraging longer product lifespans, supporting the growth of circular economy business models and helping consumers combat greenwashing and make more environmentally friendly purchasing choices, as regional lawmakers work to make good on a Circular Economy Action Plan announced two years ago. The bloc\u2019s overarching European Green Deal plan has the stated goal of making the region \u201cclimate neutral\u201d by 2050. That mission translates to no net emissions of greenhouse gases within a timeframe of (now) just under three decades while decoupling the EU\u2019s economic growth from resource use \u2014 aka a shift to a circular economy where products are designed to last longer and also to be easy to disassemble for reuse or recycling at end of life. So there is, very clearly, lots of work for policymakers to do. Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine has only added to the urgency of the EU\u2019s climate mission \u2014 underscoring the case for the bloc to rapidly move away from using fossil fuels for energy and wider economic fuel as many Member States remain heavily reliant on oil and gas from Russia, leaving their economies exposed to the ongoing regional instability. In a press release announcing its latest sustainability policy package, the Commission suggests that, by 2030, the revised ecodesign framework could lead to 132 mtoe [million tonnes of oil equivalent] of primary energy savings \u2014 which it emphasizes is \u201calmost equivalent to EU\u2019s import of Russian gas\u201d (which corresponds to \u201croughly to 150 bcm [billion cubic meters] of natural gas\u201d). It is also keen to flag the value of existing EU ecodesign requirements (which are focused on energy efficiency) \u2014 saying they saved consumers \u20ac120BN and led to a 10% lower annual energy consumption by the products in scope. The latest proposals to slot under the EU\u2019s \u2018green deal\u2019 umbrella include an interesting idea for Digital Product Passports (see below) \u2014 which is part of a wider push to increase product sustainability via a Regulation on Ecodesign for Sustainable Products (aka ESPR). The latter sets new requirements to \u201cmake products more durable, reliable, reusable, upgradable, reparable, easier to maintain, refurbish and recycle, and energy and resource efficient\u201d; and looks set to apply across the board from products such as metals and textiles all the way up to mobile phones and tablets. \u201cThe objective of the Commission\u2019s Ecodesign proposal is to make sustainable products the norm on the EU market and reduce their overall environmental and climate impacts,\u201d the EU\u2019s executive writes, adding: \u201cThe \u2018take-make-use-dispose\u2019 model can be avoided, and much of a product\u2019s environmental impacts is determined at the design stage.\u201d The ecodesign proposal extends existing EU rules in this area to both broaden the scope of products covered by ecodesign regulations (the Commission says it wants almost all products to fall in scope in the future) and to broaden requirements on those products to encompass circularity and an overall reduction of products\u2019 environmental and climate footprint, in addition to energy efficiency criteria. So it\u2019s fair to say that the bloc\u2019s concept of \u2018ecodesign\u2019 is being radically redesigned \u2014 and, well, upgraded. The Commission argues that this broader ecodesign strategy will lead to more energy and resource independence and less pollution, and also anticipates it creating \u201ceconomic opportunities for innovation and job creation\u201d, especially in areas such as remanufacturing, maintenance, recycling and repair. So hot European startups of the future could be in areas like smarter waste management and upcycling. Specific per product requirements aren\u2019t clear, as yet, as the EU\u2019s approach starts with a big picture proposal for a framework and a process \u2014 via which the Commission (\u201cworking in close cooperation with all those concerned\u201d) will gradually set out requirements for each product or group of products, yielding specific stipulations down the line. Its approach also suggests there could end up being a degree of variability in requirements across different types of products, as various trade offs (perhaps product longevity vs energy efficiency of manufacture, say) are weighed up and variously assessed in each specific product context. (Variation may also creep in as a result of sector-specific lobbying ofc.) \u201cThese ecodesign requirements will be tailored to the particular characteristics of the product groups concerned,\u201d the Commission writes in a communication on the proposal. \u201cTheir identification and development will factor-in the potential for improvement and relative effectiveness in delivering increased resource and energy efficiency, enabling longer product life and maximising the value embedded in materials, reducing pollution and the overall impact of products on climate and the environment.\u201d In a list of sample ecodesign requirements which may apply to different types of products, the communication offers examples that include mandates to minimize waste (such as packaging waste); set a minimum level of recycled content that a product must contain; and require ease of disassembly, remanufacturing and recycling of products and materials, among others. \u201cOnly a few sectors, such as food, feed, and medicinal products, are exempted,\u201d the EU further specifies in a Q&A on the sustainable products initiative which also states that incoming ecodesign and labelling rules will cover product groups which are not regulated now, such as smartphones, tablets and photovoltaic solar systems. So gadgets look set to fall squarely in scope, along with almost every other type of non-edible thing and/or material used to make things which may be picked up off a shelf by or dropshipped to an EU consumer in the future (not to mention the packaging itself). Commenting in a statement, VirginijusSinkevi\u010dius, the EU commissioner for the environment, oceans and fisheries, said: \u201cOur circular economy proposals kick off an era where products will be designed in a way that brings benefits to all, respects the boundaries of our planet and protects the environment. Giving a longer lifespan to the phones we use, to the clothes we wear and to many other products will save money for European consumers. And at the end of their life products will not be a source of pollution but of new materials for the economy, decreasing the dependency of European businesses on imports.\u201d The Commission will launch a public consultation on the categories of products to be selected under the first ESPR working plan by the end of this year \u2014 but it suggests the first focus will be on product categories such as textiles, furniture, mattresses, tyres, detergents, paints, lubricants, and on intermediate products like iron, steel and aluminium, as it says these have \u201chigh environmental impact and potential for improvement\u201d. As the bloc expands ecodesign rules, repairability in general looks set to get a massive boost \u2014 again also for electronics, an area where the Commission already said (March 2020) it would be expanding requirements. \u201cWork has advanced significantly with assessing the feasibility of ecodesign requirements and an energy labelling scheme for mobile phones and tablets,\u201d it notes in a communication on its Ecodesign and Energy Labelling Working Plan, adopted today as a transitory measure \u201cto cover new energy-related products, update and increase the ambition for products that are already regulated\u201d until the expanded ecodesign regulation enters into force. \u201cThe requirements would be affecting energy efficiency as well as material efficiency (durability, reparability, upgradability and recycling) aspects. The regulations are expected to be adopted before the end of 2022,\u201d it goes on, adding: \u201cLikewise, work is well advanced to assess the feasibility of ecodesign requirements and energy labelling for solar photovoltaic modules, inverters and systems, including possible requirements on carbon footprint.\u201d Expanded EU ecodesign rules will apply equally to all products placed on the market, regardless of country of manufacture or importation, meaning gizmos made in Asia or the US that are intended for sale within the bloc won\u2019t be able to escape compliance with the sustainability requirements. European lawmakers propose a \u2018right to repair\u2019 for mobiles and laptops A Digital Product Passport for every thing Another part of the EU\u2019s plan for revised ecodesign rules includes a proposal to introduce Digital Product Passports to store key data to improve traceability around products and support repair/recycling etc by standardizing the information which product manufacturers must provide. The Commission also intends these passports to arm consumers with information on environmental impacts to inform purchasing decisions. This could include energy consumption info but also \u2014 via new EU Energy Labels for relevant products \u2014 a repairability score. \u201c[P]roduct-specific information requirements will ensure consumers know the environmental impacts of their purchases,\u201d the Commission suggests of the Digital Product Passport plan. \u201cAll regulated products will have Digital Product Passports. This will make it easier to repair or recycle products and facilitate tracking substances of concern along the supply chain. Labelling can be introduced as well.\u201d Digital product passports will be \u201cthe norm\u201d for all products regulated under the ESPR, per the Commission \u2014 with the goal to ensure that products are \u201ctagged, identified and linked to data relevant to their circularity and sustainability\u201d. \u201cThis proposal will\u2026 enable information requirements to be set for products to know more about the impacts of the products on our shelves and make more sustainable choices along the whole value chain,\u201d it adds. How exactly this will work isn\u2019t clear but presumably something like a QR code could be fixed to each product for scanning to view the associated sustainability data. \u201cDigital Product Passports will be rolled out for all regulated products,\u201d the Commission writes. \u201cThe product information can also take the form of \u2018classes of performance\u2019 \u2014 for instance ranging from \u2018A to G\u2019 \u2014 to facilitate comparison between products, possibly displayed in the form of a label. This would work in a manner similar to how the widely recognized EU Energy Label currently works, and be for instance used for a repairability score.\u201d The EU is also eyeing the potential for this standardized \u2018metadata\u2019 system to create other data-sharing opportunities \u2014 which could even lead to other types of business opportunity, or support additional pieces of sustainability legislation across the bloc. \u201cPioneering this approach for environmental sustainability data can also pave the way for wider voluntary data sharing, going beyond the products and requirements regulated under the ESPR,\u201d the Commission suggests. \u201cMoreover, product passports may be used for information on other sustainability aspects applicable to the relevant product group pursuant to other Union legislation.\u201d \u201cStructuring information on the environmental sustainability of products and transmitting it by means of digital product passports will help businesses along the value chain, from manufacturers, importers and distributors to dealers, repairers, remanufacturers and recyclers, to access information that is valuable in their work to improve environmental performance, prolong product lifetime, boost efficiency and the use of secondary raw materials, thus lowering the need for primary natural resources, saving costs and reducing strategic dependencies,\u201d it also argues. \u201cThis will also help track the presence of substances of concern throughout the life cycle of materials and products, following through on commitments made in the Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability and contributing to the EU\u2019s aim to achieve zero pollution. Digital product passports can also enable consumers to make more informed choices, improve transparency for public interest organisations and help national authorities in their enforcement and surveillance work.\u201d Other measures in the EU\u2019s ecodesign expansion proposal seek to end the destruction of unsold consumer goods \u2014 a practice that can be disturbingly widespread in ecommerce (hi Amazon!) and fashion, for example \u2014 through \u201cfar-reaching transparency requirements for those choosing to discard unsold goods, and the possibility to ban their destruction for relevant product groups\u201d. \u201c[L]arge businesses that discard unsold products will have to disclose their number per year, the reasons for the discarding and information on the amount of discarded products that they have delivered for preparing for re-use, remanufacturing, recycling, energy recovery and disposal operations in line with the waste hierarchy. They will have to ensure this information is made available, either on a freely accessible website, or via other means,\u201d the Commission writes. \u201cThis measure will apply to all concerned economic operators as soon as the regulation enters into force. The proposal explicitly prohibits circumvention techniques, such as a big company selling to small companies (which are normally exempted) to make them destroy products.\u201d Green public procurement will also be supported through mandatory criteria in the regulation. In addition, the Commission has presented two targeted sectoral initiatives today \u2014 one focused on sustainability and circularity of textiles, with the strategy there intended to make textiles \u201cmore durable, repairable, reusable and recyclable, to tackle fast fashion, textile waste and the destruction of unsold textiles, and ensure their production takes place in full respect of social rights\u201d by 2030; and another that aims to boost the internal market for construction products while also ensuring that the regulatory framework is geared towards sustainability and climate objectives. Both sectors have high carbon footprints. Sourceful grabs $20M to make more packaging less polluting EU lawmakers agree data reuse rules to foster AI and R&D",

The World Meteorological Organization says greenhouse gas concentrations hit a new record high last year and continued to increase at a faster clip than the average rate in the last decadeLaurent Cipriani, Associated Press Utah technology executives know firsthand the transformative potential that innovation has in every aspect of life. And we know how the market works to reward and advance the best new products and technology.Thoughtful human invention makes our lives better, our world cleaner, our society stronger. Such innovation is already bringing a clean-energy, low-carbon future closer and closer.\u00a0Electric cars, for example, are cleaner and more efficient. Wind and solar have become less expensive power sources. Battery technology is advancing quickly. And next-generation nuclear and geothermal power are promising new possibilities. These are powerful trends from which Utah is already benefiting.Utahns can either embrace these energy technologies or be left behind.As technology leaders, we cannot ignore the innovative changes happening worldwide to make power cleaner. If we do, critical decisions and investments will happen elsewhere.Utah must lead out. We want these new technologies developed and deployed here. Our employees want to work at climate-conscious companies. They want to be a part of reducing air pollution here and, yes, around the world.Washington politicians and bureaucrats are now debating the best way to accelerate the progress on reducing emissions. But too much discussion centers on regulation and spending, ignoring the most critical need: government support for the innovation needed to clean and protect our environment.The good news is that is beginning to change.A new Conservative Climate Caucus, led by Utah Congressman John Curtis and joined by his fellow Utah colleagues Chris Stewart, Blake Moore and Burgess Owens, is a welcome step forward. They see the need for the next phase of innovation on clean energy and want to find responsible ways to encourage it.We don\u2019t need more regulations burdening and holding back the economy. We don\u2019t need government picking and choosing the winning technologies. What we need are clear and powerful incentives to develop new and better energy technologies to compete in the global market.Developing energy technologies generally requires a long-term investment from businesses and investors who need predictability and stable support for climate and environmental innovation, or those investments won\u2019t happen and those innovations won\u2019t occur.We believe strongly that capitalism and our markets \u2014 if allowed to operate without burdensome regulation \u2014 will find the best solutions.Today, there is no cost to use our air as a dumping ground for the byproducts of inefficient energy use. Polluters don\u2019t pay for it the way we do for our sewers, trash and almost every other byproduct of human life. In effect, today\u2019s policies subsidize and encourage pollution. That strikes us as working\u00a0against, rather than\u00a0for, innovation that can reduce emissions and clean the air.If policymakers incentivize the market to give us clean air and zero-carbon energy, then the market will deliver. And it will do it at scale.One possible option to reduce emissions is a carbon dividend approach. Here\u2019s how it works: Fossil fuel companies would be charged a fee for their emissions.\u00a0All\u00a0the money from those fees would be returned to the American people in the form of dividend checks. Those responsible for lower emissions would come out ahead.What about foreign polluters? Under a carbon dividend approach, a border adjustmentwould hold other countries accountable for their emissions, so businesses in Utah and across the United States can compete on a level playing field. Other countries \u2014 at least those wanting to sell products or do business in the U.S. \u2014 would no longer be allowed to pollute for free.Regardless of the approach, what is needed is a simple, transparent and effective way to unleash the full power of American ingenuity toward a low-carbon future. Whether it\u2019s small businesses, large corporations, utilities or individual households, a market-based approach will incentivize everyone to reduce emissions, or switch to newer, cleaner and more cost-effective technologies. It will be in their self-interest to do so.As technology executives, we value solutions that acknowledge technical progress, encourage innovation and let businesses compete in the market for the best solutions. Our country was built on market principles that allow invention and innovation to flourish.Now is the time for our representatives in Washington to act to encourage businesses to bring about a clean energy transition.David Bywater is CEO of Vivint; Adam Edmunds is CEO of Entrata; Jonathan Johnson is CEO of Overstock; Sam Malouf is CEO of Malouf; Jeff Pedersen is CEO of Cariloha; Davis Smith is CEO of Cotopaxi; and Ryan Westwood is CEO of Simplus.",

The company claims that the device is a \u201cset of noise-cancelling, high fidelity over-ear headphones which simultaneously delivers immersive sound to the ears, and purified airflow to the nose and mouth.\u201d The company in a press note stated that the Dyson Zone \u201csimultaneously tackles the urban issues of air quality and noise pollution.\u201d Dyson Zone features two large earcups connected via a metal-reinforced headband. The headphones also feature another band, which will cover the face of the wearer like a mask and act as an air purifier. As of now, the company has only revealed the Zone headphones, with a release date set for later this fall. The company did not reveal any specific details like price or specifications. The Zone headphones feature a miniaturised version of the company\u2019s existing air filtration technology. The company has revealed that the device will pull in the air through each earpiece using a pair of tiny compressors, which it will then filter and pipe through the visor. The visor will be seated away from the user\u2019s face, creating a bubble of clean air for the user to breathe. The company will also release an additional accessory, which can be clipped on in instances where the user needs full contact. The visor will latch on using a series of magnets, and can be removed easily. It also consists of accelerometers to automatically adjust the airflow according to the activity being performed. The company claims that Zone can filter up to 99 percent of particle pollution. The filters are not reusable and will require replacement after a year of use. Coming to the headphones, it features three different modes for noise cancellation. In isolation mode, it will have active ANC, in conversation mode ANC will be disabled, and in the transparency mode it will filter out sounds like car horns and sirens.

Related Welcome to winter in Utah. \u2019Tis the season for gunky inversions Nick Torres, advocacy director for the American Lung Association, said the report builds on research released two years ago that focused on electrifying the nation\u2019s vehicle fleet.\u201cWe wanted to expand it beyond the implementation of rolling out electric vehicles and also look at the impact of what it would look like for us to convert our electrical production to noncombustion, renewable electricity,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really wanted to look at and highlight the potential public health benefits that would come from dramatically improving the air we breathe in a very tangible way.\u201dUnder such a scenario by 2050, Utah could realize $5.7 billion in public health benefits, avoid 506 deaths directly linked to air pollution, eliminate 26,700 asthma attacks and reduce lost work days by 94,300.Along the Wasatch Front, tailpipe emissions are responsible for about half the fine particulate pollution, or PM2.5, that dogs the area during winter inversions. Related Electrified transportation: Why it matters for Utah\u2019s Olympic future Utah, 6 other states pursue regional electric vehicle network The report noted: Nationally, 4 in 10 U.S. residents, or 135 million people, live in communities with unhealthy levels of air pollution.Air pollution disproportionately impacts people of color and low-income households.People living near ports, highways, railroad yards and other transportation hubs are at greater risk from impacts of air pollution.Torres said people who are at greater risk such as the young, the elderly or those with respiratory issues such as asthma look at air pollution differently \u2014 they have to.\u201cWe know that air quality action days lead to additional visits to the emergency room and we know of the other problems among the most vulnerable populations. By taking these emissions off the table, we can see substantial impacts to the health of Utah residents,\u201d he said. Related Air pollution linked to memory declines among older women Studies link air pollution to increased risk of strokes and dementia Torres acknowledged that electric vehicles are pricey and not accessible for many residents, but said that is where all elected leaders can step in and provide incentives to make the transition easier.\u201cWe\u2019re calling on our elected leaders, our state, local and federal officials to really prioritize health equity in this process.\u201d Related Utah lawmakers, Union Pacific make nice: Bill to force clean switchers put on hold In this last legislative session, Utah lawmakers agreed to spend $3 million on a rural electric vehicle charging effort. Additionally, they create a grid resilience committee and directed Utah air quality regulators to assess diesel emissions in a new inventory. The state also adopted an electric vehicle master plan several years ago.",

Dyson is confident it will work well outdoors, including when wind is blowing at you. That said, the Dyson Zone is not certified to protect against Covid, meaning that in situations where you\u2019ll need an N95 or FFP2 mask, just the visor alone will not be sufficient. But Dyson has a solution for that (more below). Dyson Zone early prototypes Dyson Zone has four air purification modes: low, medium, high and Auto, meant for different levels of exertion. In Auto, it uses accelerometers to detect your speed and is smart enough to decide when you are running or climbing the stairs, which of the low, medium or high modes to toggle automatically. For its headphones, it features the expected active noise cancellation (ANC) prominent in many of today\u2019s best audio wear. It has 3 ANC modes: isolation, the highest level of noise filtering; conversation, which activates when you dip the visor that automatically turns off purification; and transparency, which amplifies ambient sound to let you be aware of your surroundings. Overall, you can wear the Dyson Zone in a few ways. You can ditch the visor and wear it like a normal pair of headphones. Or you can wear it as it is meant to be worn, with visor and ANC on for the best protection against the scourge of dust and noise. In places where you\u2019ll need to mask up against COVID-19, both a regular face mask and an FFP2 mask are provided with the box, which fits with the Dyson Zone to provide a sealed environment. The Dyson Zone has been product tested in many environments, including in Malaysia by its Malaysia Development Centre team. It is promised to be robust and durable enough even in hot and humid regions of Southeast Asia like Singapore. Other specifications for the Dyson Zone such as its weight or retail price has not been released yet. Dyson Zone is expected to be made available online and at Dyson Demo Stores in Fall 2022.

It is promised to be robust and durable enough even in hot and humid regions of Southeast Asia like Singapore. Other specifications for the Dyson Zone such as its weight or retail price has not been released yet. Dyson Zone is expected to be made available online and at Dyson Demo Stores in Fall 2022. And with it, our march into a dystopian cyberpunk future begins (perhaps).

The Dyson Zone\u2122 is a set of noise-cancelling, high fidelity over-ear headphones which simultaneously deliver immersive sound to the ears, and purified airflow to the nose and mouth. The result of over a decade of air quality research and development, the Dyson Zone\u2122 air-purifying headphones simultaneously tackle the urban issues of air quality and noise pollution.As the world's urban population continues to grow, the World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that 9 in 10 people globally breathe air that exceeds WHO guideline pollutant limits. Where NO2 pollution in cities decreased during the Covid-19 pandemic, levels have quickly returned to normal or exceeded pre-pandemic levels across various Indian cities.Jake Dyson, Chief Engineer said:\"Air pollution is a global problem \u2013 it affects us everywhere we go. In our homes, at school, at work and as we travel, whether on foot, on a bike or by public or private transport. The Dyson Zone\u2122 purifies the air you breathe on the move. And unlike face masks, it delivers a plume of fresh air without touching your face, using high-performance filters and two miniaturised air pumps. After six years in development, we're excited to deliver pure air and pure audio, anywhere.\"6 years & 500 prototypesThe Dyson Zone\u2122 air-purifying headphones are borne of Dyson's 30 years of expertise in airflow, filtration and motors technologies and a deep understanding of indoor and outdoor air quality. The compressors in each earcup draw air through the dual-layer filters and project two streams of purified air to the wearer's nose and mouth, channelled through the non-contact visor. Sculpted returns on the visor ensure purified airflow is kept near to the nose and mouth and diluted as little as possible by external crosswinds. The Dyson Zone\u2122 delivers rich, immersive audio and relief from unwanted city noise thanks to advanced active noise cancelling (ANC), low distortion and neutral frequency response, to faithfully replicate music or audio as the creator intended.\u00a0The Dyson Zone on the company's testing platformOriginally a snorkel-like clean air mouthpiece paired with a backpack to hold the motor and inner workings, the Dyson Zone\u2122 air-purifying headphones evolved dramatically over its six years in development. More than 500 prototypes saw one motor initially placed at the nape become two compressors, one in each ear cup and the evolution of the snorkel mouthpiece into an effective, contact-free visor that delivers clean air without full-face contact \u2013 a brand-new clean air delivery mechanism.Developing a non-contact solution was a must for Dyson engineers, to avoid the discomfort and irritation often associated with full-contact alternatives. The visor, therefore, was a critical element. The airflow pathways and visor design are central to delivering pure air. The geometries of the visor and the visor returns, alongside the central mesh that diffuses the two jets of airflow, ensure that the purified air exiting the filters is effectively delivered to the nose and mouth in crosswinds, and for the wearer's specific facial shape. Going beyond existing testing methods, Dyson engineers use a breathing manikin fitted with medical-grade mechanical lungs and sensing equipment, which 'inhales' pollution by replicating human breathing patterns in a controlled chamber. They then measure the pollution level within the nose and throat to determine the filtration efficacy of those particles which would otherwise end up in Frank's artificial lung.Precision-engineered compressors within the earcups draw air through the dual-layer filters, intelligently designed to fit within the considerable space constraints of a headphone. The negatively charged electrostatic filter media captures ultrafine particles such as allergens, and particles from sources such as brake dust, industry combustion and construction whilst a potassium-enriched carbon layer captures city gas pollutants like NO2 and SO2. The compressor channels the purified air to the wearer's nose and mouth via the contact-free visor, formed with flexible returns that to channel the flow of purified air to the wearer's nose and mouth.A scientific approachA first foray into the world of audio, Dyson engineers took a scientific approach, choosing not to rely on a 'golden listener' approach that many others do. Dyson's team of audio engineers and acousticians sought to engineer excellent audio led by metrics, backed up with extensive listening trials. The result: pure, rich audio and advanced noise cancellation. Despite the space constraints inherent with a wearable device, Dyson engineers developed a high performing neodymium electroacoustic system within each earcup. A wide frequency response, precise left-right balance and distortion significantly below what can be detected by the human ear, offer a faithful reproduction as the musicians or creators intended.Through solving the problem of Dyson's own creation, the engineers have developed an advanced noise cancellation system. Together, the device's passive attenuation and the ANC, with its unique array of microphones, reduce unwanted environmental noise and motor tones to provide advanced noise cancellation at home, at work and on the go. Large, angled ear cushions mould around the listener's ear, with a foam density and headband clamp force engineered specifically for both comfort and optimal noise reduction. Engineered for comfortEvery head on the planet is unique. As Dyson's first wearable, Dyson engineers had to think about comfort in a new way. Detailed research into head and face geometries meant engineers could measure how the Dyson Zone\u2122 air-purifying headphones would sit on and perform on different heads\u2013 informing the clamp force of the headband, the geometry and materials of the visor, the adjustability of the machine and much more.\u00a0Engineered specifically for both comfort and optimal noise reductionTaking inspiration from the shape and design of a horse's saddle, the Dyson Zone\u2122 is engineered to distribute weight over the sides of the head, rather than on the top. A saddle typically curves over the horse's spine distributing the load through contact with the areas left and right of the backbone \u2013 a format used for the central cushion on the headband.The development of the ear cushions is important for three reasons: comfort, on-head stability and passive attenuation. Foam is an obvious choice for ear cushions but Dyson engineers dug deep into the make-up of different foams to choose the most suitable material based on density, rate of compression and spring-back rate \u2013 all of which change the way pressure translates onto the head. When choosing the optimal foam for the ear and headband cushions, it was important to balance the comfort it provides, its stability when moulded to the ear, and critically the acoustic benefit it provides. Moulding around the ear increases the size of the contact points providing better sealing \u2013 and inhibiting additional urban noise entering the ear. The cushion is purposefully flatter than conventional ear cushions for both attenuation and comfort, and the cushions are angled in line with the angle of the ear on the head for optimal comfort. A global effortThe Dyson Zone\u2122 air-purifying headphones have been engineered by teams across the UK, Singapore, Malaysia and China, with a particular focus on software on our South East Asia campuses. The app development and integration was a critical project to ensure a smooth connection journey and provide intelligent, meaningful air and noise pollution tracking features. Robustness and durability are central to a product that leaves the home with the wearer. As with all Dyson machines, the Dyson Zone\u2122 air-purifying headphones have been tested to the extremes \u2013 in temperature-controlled chambers, drop-testing, material and fabric wear testing, button robustness and much more. Our expert test engineers in the Dyson Malaysia Development Centre are integral to this, as is the geography \u2013 putting it through its paces in warmer climates and higher humidity compared to UK-based testing.The Dyson Zone\u2122 air-purifying headphones will be available globally from Autumn 2022.

It has also been decided to plan a campaign against open burning of garbage and fires at landfill sites, Mr. Rai said at a press conference. \u201cWe had asked the DPCC to submit a fact-finding report. They have submitted a detailed report today which points to carelessness on the part of the municipal corporation,\u201d Mr. Rai said. There\u2019s smoke emanating from the fire spot even after 48 hours of the incident. High temperature and methane gas produced from the rotting garbage led to the fire, he said citing the report. The report talks about the sluggish pace of biomining of legacy waste at the site. Only 21 trommel machines are being used there in place of 25, Mr. Rai said. The anti-smog gun deployed at the site is not functioning. Of the 24 CCTV cameras installed there to monitor such fires, only 17 are operating, he said. The construction of a boundary wall to thwart entry of unauthorised persons at the landfill has not been completed yet, the Minister said. \u201cIn view of these shortcomings, the DPCC has been asked to impose a fine of \u20b950 lakh on the municipal corporation and take action against officials responsible,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have also decided to convene a high-level meeting of departments concerned on April 4 to plan a campaign to stop burning of waste and fires at landfill sites,\u201d he added.

            "content": "Locals are suffering the polluting consequences of the dump (Picture: Michael Quezada) Around 39,000 tons of fast fashion was dumped in Chile\u2019s Atacama Desert just last year, according to a new study. Sum of Us, a non-profit advocacy organisation that aims to \u2018hold large corporations to account\u2019 on issues such as climate change, corruption and workers rights, found that an enormous amount of clothes are piling up in \u2018micro-dumps\u2019, which could be having a huge impact on the environment and local communities. H&M and Adidas were among the brands with the most clothes left to build up in the world\u2019s driest desert. The build up of toxic waste, which is either left to rot or burned, was also found to be having a profound effect on local residents, some of whom are the poorest in the Alto Hospicio region. From pollution to pests, locals are suffering the worst consequences of the tons of fast fashion being dumped on their doorstep. How do these clothes end up in Chile? Every year, around 59,000 tons of secondhand and unsold clothing, often made in China or Bangladesh, reaches Chile \u2013 Latin America\u2019s biggest importer of secondhand clothing \u2013 after passing through Europe, Asia or the United States.\u00a0 The clothes are sent to the Iquique port in the Alto Hospicio free zone in northern Chile.\u00a0From there, around 15% of the clothes are resold around Latin America, according to Alto Hospicio mayor, Patricio Ferreira. The leftover 85%, however, is left in the free zone.\u00a0 Angela Astudillo, a local Iquique resident and coordinator of local activist group Desierto Vestido (which translates to desert dress in English), tells Metro.co.uk that the clothes are categorised into \u2018first, second and third selection.\u2019 \u2018These [clothes] are sold to different boutiques and stores that sell this type of clothing here in Iquique and are also sold abroad in Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, where they enter illegally since they have policies that prohibit the entry of such clothes,\u2019 she said. \u2018The problem starts because there are many clothes that come with broken details, so these clothes must be selected again and this is where the discarding of clothes occurs.\u2019 \u2018Mountains of waste\u2019 left in the world\u2019s driest desert (Picture: Michael Quezada) Among the clothes are old tyres, plastics, wires and other rubbish (Picture: Michael Quezada) Any clothes that can\u2019t be categorised into either first, second or third selection are left as rubbish.\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018As there is no final disposal for this waste, it ends up dumped not only in this landfill but also in different parts of the municipality, which then become like micro-dumps,\u2019 Astudillo adds. Due to the fact that these clothes are made from synthetic materials and chemical products, meaning they are not biodegradable and take more than 200 years to decompose, municipal dumps won\u2019t accept the clothes, so they\u2019re left piling up in the desert, ten minutes away from the city of Iquique.\u00a0 Although, Astudillo noted, there are companies that attempt to dispose of the waste properly, people often aren\u2019t willing to pay the fees associated with this, and one small company that recycles the fabric, EcoFibra, can\u2019t cope with the \u2018mountains of waste that is produced.\u2019 H&M and Adidas among the most dumped clothing Sum of Us sent a small team to investigate the dumping ground in a bid to find out which brands were the biggest culprits. \u2018Given the enormity of the piles of clothing found in the Atacama Desert, it was impossible to sort through it all, so samples were taken at different locations in the dumping grounds,\u2019 Sum of Us said.\u00a0 \u2018Within one hour of sorting through the clothing, many of the most world renowned fashion brands were discovered.\u2019 {\"@context\":\"https:\\/\\/schema.org\",\"@type\":\"VideoObject\",\"name\":\"Metro.co.uk\",\"duration\":\"T1M8S\",\"thumbnailUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/i.dailymail.co.uk\\/1s\\/2022\\/03\\/29\\/12\\/55950471-0-image-a-1_1648554920282.jpg\",\"uploadDate\":\"2022-03-29T12:52:46+0100\",\"description\":\"Global fashion brands are dumping perfectly good clothes in Chile.\",\"contentUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/videos.metro.co.uk\\/video\\/met\\/2022\\/03\\/29\\/8934410406323768862\\/480x270_MP4_8934410406323768862.mp4\",\"height\":270,\"width\":480} To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Its investigation found that Old Navy made up most of the brands they discovered, followed by H&M, Adidas and Levi\u2019s.

Additional markets will follow this year.\u2019 Old Navy, Levi\u2019s, Zara, Hugo Boss, Under Armour, Tommy Hilfiger and Nike have been contacted by Metro.co.uk, but are yet to respond. Locals are suffering the consequences The clothes are sent in large garbage bales, along with shoes, plastics, wires, wallets, household, cardboard and other rubbish, to the clothing dump. Beyond the dump, residents of the Alto Hospicio region are dealing with porter trucks driving through the area to dump the waste, causing pollution and soil contamination.\u00a0 She added that the dump attracts \u2018vectors\u2019 (disease-carrying insects, like tics) to the local area. \u2018When they burn these clothes, all of this contamination affects the people who live here.\u2019 SumOfUs investigated the site to find out which brands were the main culprits (Picture: Michael Quezada) Closer to the dumping ground, locals are dealing with even worse conditions.\u00a0 According to SumOfUs and Desierto Vestido, around 1,000 of the most impoverished people in Chile live on or near to the actual dumping grounds. \u2018The residents live off the clothes,\u2019 Astudillo said. \u2018But they only separate clothes they plan to resell and throw away or burn the rest.\u2019 One local resident who lives just outside of the dumping ground, who wanted to remain anonymous, told Metro.co.uk: \u2018Those of us who live in these houses are mainly affected by the infection that is created by the accumulation of this waste and the plague of rats it brings.\u00a0 \u2018Every time there is a fire, it takes days to burn out and, for some people, the smoke causes allergic reactions, respiratory difficulties or vomiting.\u00a0 \u2018We cannot go anywhere else \u2013 this is where we live and we are in an extremely precarious situation.\u00a0 \u2018Everyday we are at risk that there will be another fire and that our families will suffer the consequences.\u2019 Around 1,000 of Alto Hospicio\u2019s poorest residents live a stone\u2019s throw away from the dumping ground (Picture: Michael Quezada) Laura Krasovitzky, of SumOfUs, said: \u2018While the last few months brought media coverage to how the Atacama Desert has turned into a fast fashion dump, no one talked about the companies involved in this dirty supply chain.\u00a0 \u2018At SumOfUs, we wanted to shine a light on the biggest corporate culprits contributing to this environmental disaster so we sent an investigative team that not only confirmed our suspicions on how some of the world\u2019s most well-known fashion brands were present in the desert, but also unveiled how close the dump site is to local communities.

            "content": "New Delhi: Amid the rising oil prices, the government is constantly considering other fuel options through which vehicles can be run on roads. The Union Road and Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari himself is constantly emphasizing Electronic Vehicles, CNG, PNG, and Hydrogen. Today, Nitin Gadkari came to parliament by using a hydrogen car and he said that he want hydrogen to be used more and more. The hydrogen car is a completely different car on its own and it can cover a distance of 600 km when the tank is full. The cost per kilometer is just Rs 2. In addition to this, it takes only 5 minutes to fill the hydrogen fuel in the car. Hydrogen Is Made From Water Earlier, speaking further in the parliament, Gadkari had said that now the day is not far when we will run the car with green hydrogen which is made from water. ''Now soon we will move towards this option. It can be made using sewage water. I sell the sewage water of my parliamentary constituency to the Maharashtra government, from which we get a royalty of Rs 325 crore every year. Using this water we can make green hydrogen,'' he added. What is Green Hydrogen? Hydrogen is produced when electricity is passed through water. This hydrogen is used to power many things. If the electricity used to make hydrogen comes from a renewable source, that is, from a source that does not cause pollution in the production of electricity, then the hydrogen thus formed is called green hydrogen. Advantages And Disadvantages of Hydrogen Car For example, let's consider windmills and solar power which generate energy without pollution, but it is not useful in every industry. Even today coal is needed in industries like steel and cement. At the same time, liquid fuel is being needed for airlines and water ships. All these won't be running with only solar energy or windmills. In such a situation, there is a need for hydrogen, which can be used for long distances in airlines and ships including in the steel-cement industry. It can be stored and then used as per the requirement. There are many benefits of green hydrogen, but here the question arises whether it also has some risks or not? Even though green hydrogen has many advantages, its disadvantages are also not less. When it comes to safety, hydrogen is highly flammable. That is, if the diesel-petrol tank leaks, it will spread on the ground, but a small spark or leak in the hydrogen tank can have dire consequences.Also read: Death Would Come as a Relief to me: Elon MuskAlso watch:",

            "full_description": "New Delhi: Amid the rising oil prices, the government is constantly considering other fuel options through which vehicles can be run on roads. The Union Road and Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari himself is constantly emphasizing Electronic Vehicles, CNG, PNG, and Hydrogen. Today, Nitin Gadkari came to parliament by using a hydrogen car and he said that he want hydrogen to be used more and more. The hydrogen car is a completely different car on its own and it can cover a distance of 600 km when the tank is full. The cost per kilometer is just Rs 2. In addition to this, it takes only 5 minutes to fill the hydrogen fuel in the car. Earlier, speaking further in the parliament, Gadkari had said that now the day is not far when we will run the car with green hydrogen which is made from water. ''Now soon we will move towards this option. It can be made using sewage water. I sell the sewage water of my parliamentary constituency to the Maharashtra government, from which we get a royalty of Rs 325 crore every year. Using this water we can make green hydrogen,'' he added. Hydrogen is produced when electricity is passed through water. This hydrogen is used to power many things. If the electricity used to make hydrogen comes from a renewable source, that is, from a source that does not cause pollution in the production of electricity, then the hydrogen thus formed is called green hydrogen. For example, let's consider windmills and solar power which generate energy without pollution, but it is not useful in every industry. Even today coal is needed in industries like steel and cement. At the same time, liquid fuel is being needed for airlines and water ships. All these won't be running with only solar energy or windmills. In such a situation, there is a need for hydrogen, which can be used for long distances in airlines and ships including in the steel-cement industry. It can be stored and then used as per the requirement. There are many benefits of green hydrogen, but here the question arises whether it also has some risks or not? Even though green hydrogen has many advantages, its disadvantages are also not less. When it comes to safety, hydrogen is highly flammable. That is, if the diesel-petrol tank leaks, it will spread on the ground, but a small spark or leak in the hydrogen tank can have dire consequences.

            "description": "The American Lung Association has released a report detailing the public health benefits of a complete national shift to zero-emission vehicles from 2020 to 2050. Apparently, if all new passenger and heavy-duty vehicles sold by 2035 and 2040, respectively, are zero-emission models, 110,000 deaths could be avoided in the United States over the next 30 years. That figure came from the association's analysis, which also projects that the Biden administration will achieve its target of having 100 percent carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035.With no air pollution affecting people's health, up to 2.79 million asthma attacks could also be avoided. And perhaps to convince companies to get onboard with the transition, the association also made it a point to mention that up to 13.4 million lost workdays could be avoided with cleaner air.\u00a0Harold Wimmer, National President and CEO of the American Lung Association, said in a statement:\"Zero-emission transportation is a win-win for public health. Too many communities across the U.S. deal with high levels of dangerous pollution from nearby highways and trucking corridors, ports, warehouses and other pollution hot spots. Plus, the transportation sector is the nation\u2019s biggest source of carbon pollution that drives climate change and associated public health harms. This is an urgent health issue for millions of people in the U.S.\"The widespread transition to zero-emission vehicles would generate up to $1.2 trillion in public health benefits, the report noted, and $1.7 trillion in climate benefits. Communities and counties with the highest percentage of lower-income families and People of Color in the US would benefit greatly from the shift, since they have areas with highly concentrated doses of pollution from diesel hotspots, power plants and other fossil fuel facilities. The top metro locations that would benefit the most include Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, San Jose, Washington, Miami, Houston, Detroit and Dallas Fort-Worth.\u00a0To be able to ensure that all new vehicles sold by 2040 are zero-emission and that the grid can supply the country with pollution-free electricity within 15 years, the association has listed a series of recommendations. They include a call for increased funding for non-combustion electricity generation and transportation, extending and expanding incentives for zero-emission vehicle purchases and \"converting public fleets to zero-emission vehicles immediately.\" The association is also urging the Congress to pass legislation that would accelerate the transition and for the EPA to adopt standards that would require lower carbon emissions from vehicles before the shift is complete.\u00a0",

Here is what\u2019s on the radar of our editors for the morning of March 30 \u2026 What we are watching in Canada \u2026 The chief of a First Nation searching for unmarked graves at a former residential school in British Columbia says they\u2019re looking for long-term funding as they prepare for a visit today by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Chief Willie Sellars from Williams Lake First Nation says his community, along with others conducting similar investigations at former government-funded, church-run institutions across Canada need financial support for their work from start to finish. He says reconciliation starts with a healthy community, and they also need long-term funding to support the mental health and well-being of residential school survivors, their families, and Indigenous communities. The First Nation in B.C.\u2019s central interior announced in January that a preliminary geophysical investigation had found 93 \u201creflections\u201d that could indicate children buried around the site of the former St. Joseph\u2019s Mission Residential School. He says they need Ottawa to provide complete records about the institution, along with support in urging the Roman Catholic Church to do the same, as they work to identify children who never returned home. Sellars says the federal government\u2019s role in advancing reconciliation should also include support for economic development and key community needs, like housing. The investigation at St. Joseph\u2019s came after ground-penetrating radar located what are believed to be more than 200 graves at a former institution in Kamloops last year. Trudeau told media in Vancouver on Tuesday that he was looking forward to meeting with Sellars to talk about the challenges and hardships his community and others have experienced since the finding of unmarked graves. \u2014 Also this \u2026 A former junior hockey player with life-altering injuries from a bus crash in Saskatchewan is getting a boost he\u2019s been anticipating for two years. Ryan Straschnitzki was paralyzed from the chest down when a bus carrying the Humboldt Broncos was in a crash in 2018, killing 16 and injuring three others. He had an epidural implant in his spine three years ago to help stimulate nerves and move limbs. Since receiving the implant, Straschnitzki has been able to stand on his own and take a few steps with a walker. This week, the 22-year-old is having the stimulator reprogrammed in Calgary to make sure it continues to work efficiently. A planned upgrade was delayed for two years because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Straschnitzki, who hopes to excel at sledge hockey, says has been working to improve his core strength. He says he is hopeful the upgrade will help him continue to make progress, because over time bodies get adapted to certain stimulation. \u2014 What we are watching in the U.S. \u2026 SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Tuesday blocked parole for Charles Manson follower Leslie Van Houten, reversing a panel\u2019s recommendation that she be freed after spending a half-century in prison. Van Houten, 72, \u201ccurrently poses an unreasonable danger to society if released from prison at this time,\u201d Newsom said in his parole review. It was the fifth time that a California governor has rejected her release. Her attorney, Rich Pfeiffer, disputed that view and said the decision will be appealed in court. He accused Newsom of rejecting parole because he is worried about \u201chis political future\u201d and noted that Van Houten has a spotless prison disciplinary record. Van Houten is serving a life sentence for helping Manson and others kill Los Angeles grocer Leno LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary, in August 1969. Van Houten was 19 when she and other cult members fatally stabbed the LaBiancas and smeared the couple\u2019s blood on the walls. The day before, other Manson followers, not including Van Houten, killed pregnant actress Sharon Tate and four others. In his rejection letter, Newsom noted that Van Housen had undergone therapy, earned educational degrees and taken self-help classes in prison and had shown \u201cincreased maturity and rehabilitation.\u201d But Van Houten also has \u201cgaps in insight\u201d that continue to make her a danger to society, Newsom said. Van Houten has had 21 parole hearings since 1982. Most parole boards denied her bid for freedom. But five panels have recommended her release since 2016, saying she had expressed remorse and was no longer a threat to public safety. Newsom rejected a recommendation made last November, and previously reversed parole recommendations in 2019 and 2020. In February, the California Supreme Court refused to hear Van Houten\u2019s appeal of the 2020 rejection. \u2014 What we are watching in the rest of the world \u2026 KYIV, Ukraine _ Russia\u2019s pledge to scale back some military operations in Ukraine drew skepticism even as the two nations planned to return Wednesday to talks that could produce a framework for ending the war that has imposed an increasingly punishing toll. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said there was no reason to believe Russia\u2019s announcement that it would reduce military activity near Kyiv, the capital, as well as in the northern city of Chernihiv, given what\u2019s still happening on the ground. \u201cWe can call those signals that we hear at the negotiations positive,\u201d he said in his nightly video address to the Ukrainian people. \u201cBut those signals don\u2019t silence the explosions of Russian shells.\u201d It was a bitter reality check in a rare moment of optimism five weeks into what has devolved into a bloody war of attrition, with thousands dead and almost 4 million Ukrainians fleeing the country. Earlier Tuesday, Ukraine\u2019s delegation at the conference, held in Istanbul, laid out a framework under which the country would declare itself neutral and its security would be guaranteed by an array of other nations. Moscow\u2019s public reaction was positive, and the negotiations were expected to resume Wednesday in Istanbul. Meanwhile, Germany triggered an early warning level for natural gas supplies and called on consumers to save energy amid concerns that Russia could cut off deliveries unless it is paid in rubles. Western nations have rejected the Russian demand for ruble payments, arguing it would undermine the sanctions imposed against Moscow over the war in Ukraine. \u2014 On this day in 1972 \u2026 Canadian sailors got a daily rum ration for the last time, ending a navy tradition dating back to 1667. \u2014 In entertainment \u2026 NEW YORK _ Foo Fighters have cancelled all upcoming concert dates following the death of the band\u2019s drummer, Taylor Hawkins. The rockers had been scheduled to play at the Grammy Awards in Las Vegas on Sunday as well as spring dates at the Beale Street Music Festival; the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival; Columbia, Maryland; Raleigh, North Carolina; Daytona Beach; Charlotte, North Carolina; the Boston Calling Music Festival; and summer dates in Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, France and the UK. \u201cIt is with great sadness that Foo Fighters confirm the cancellation of all upcoming tour dates in light of the staggering loss of our brother,\u201d the band said in a statement Tuesday. Hawkins died Friday during a South American tour with the rock band. He was 50. \u201cWe\u2019re sorry for and share in the disappointment that we won\u2019t be seeing one another as planned,\u201d the band\u2019s statement read. \u201cInstead, let\u2019s take this time to grieve, to heal, to pull our loved ones close, and to appreciate all the music and memories we\u2019ve made together.\u201d Hawkins was Alanis Morissette\u2019s touring drummer when he joined Foo Fighters in 1997. He played on the band\u2019s biggest albums including \u201cOne by One\u201d and \u201cIn Your Honor,\u201d and on hit singles like \u201cBest of You.\u201d In lead singer David Grohl\u2019s 2021 book \u201cThe Storyteller,\u201d he called Hawkins his \u201cbrother from another mother, my best friend, a man for whom I would take a bullet.\u201d \u2014 Did you see this? OTTAWA _ Canada\u2019s Conservatives continue to reject the target the Liberal government set for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, as the party searches for a new leader who will decide its approach to tackle climate change. On Tuesday, the federal government released its plan for how it hopes to achieve its latest goal, which is to cut carbon-related pollution by 40 to 45 per cent from 2005 levels by the end of the decade. Tory environment critic Kyle Seeback says the party doesn\u2019t support that plan. Instead, it favours the target the Conservative government set back in 2015 under the leadership of former prime minister Stephen Harper. When he came into office later that year, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signed onto the plan, committing under the Paris agreement to reduce the country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. Last year Trudeau increased those targets ahead of international climate talks in the fall, saying Canada now aims for 40 to 45 per cent below 2005 levels. \u201cIt\u2019s great to intend things and to hope for things,\u201d Seeback said on Tuesday. \u201cWhat we need (are) actual plans that result in emission reductions and what we get from this government are plans that cost a lot of money.\u201d He pointed out that the Liberals have failed to achieve past climate goals and dismissed the plan presented Tuesday as lacking in details about the impact the reductions would have on resource-based industries and taxpayers. \u201cI\u2019m all for aspirational things, but at the end of the day, what we need are plans that actually work and don\u2019t have incredibly catastrophic effects on the Canadian economy.\u201d \u2014 This report by The Canadian Press was first published March 30, 2022.

Here is what\u2019s on the radar of our editors for the morning of March 30 \u2026 What we are watching in Canada \u2026 The chief of a First Nation searching for unmarked graves at a former residential school in British Columbia says they\u2019re looking for long-term funding as they prepare for a visit today by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Chief Willie Sellars from Williams Lake First Nation says his community, along with others conducting similar investigations at former government-funded, church-run institutions across Canada need financial support for their work from start to finish. He says reconciliation starts with a healthy community, and they also need long-term funding to support the mental health and well-being of residential school survivors, their families, and Indigenous communities. The First Nation in B.C.\u2019s central interior announced in January that a preliminary geophysical investigation had found 93 \u201creflections\u201d that could indicate children buried around the site of the former St. Joseph\u2019s Mission Residential School. He says they need Ottawa to provide complete records about the institution, along with support in urging the Roman Catholic Church to do the same, as they work to identify children who never returned home. Sellars says the federal government\u2019s role in advancing reconciliation should also include support for economic development and key community needs, like housing. The investigation at St. Joseph\u2019s came after ground-penetrating radar located what are believed to be more than 200 graves at a former institution in Kamloops last year. Trudeau told media in Vancouver on Tuesday that he was looking forward to meeting with Sellars to talk about the challenges and hardships his community and others have experienced since the finding of unmarked graves. \u2014 Also this \u2026 A former junior hockey player with life-altering injuries from a bus crash in Saskatchewan is getting a boost he\u2019s been anticipating for two years. Ryan Straschnitzki was paralyzed from the chest down when a bus carrying the Humboldt Broncos was in a crash in 2018, killing 16 and injuring three others. He had an epidural implant in his spine three years ago to help stimulate nerves and move limbs. Since receiving the implant, Straschnitzki has been able to stand on his own and take a few steps with a walker. This week, the 22-year-old is having the stimulator reprogrammed in Calgary to make sure it continues to work efficiently. A planned upgrade was delayed for two years because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Straschnitzki, who hopes to excel at sledge hockey, says has been working to improve his core strength. He says he is hopeful the upgrade will help him continue to make progress, because over time bodies get adapted to certain stimulation. \u2014 What we are watching in the U.S. \u2026 SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Tuesday blocked parole for Charles Manson follower Leslie Van Houten, reversing a panel\u2019s recommendation that she be freed after spending a half-century in prison. Van Houten, 72, \u201ccurrently poses an unreasonable danger to society if released from prison at this time,\u201d Newsom said in his parole review. It was the fifth time that a California governor has rejected her release. Her attorney, Rich Pfeiffer, disputed that view and said the decision will be appealed in court. He accused Newsom of rejecting parole because he is worried about \u201chis political future\u201d and noted that Van Houten has a spotless prison disciplinary record. Van Houten is serving a life sentence for helping Manson and others kill Los Angeles grocer Leno LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary, in August 1969. Van Houten was 19 when she and other cult members fatally stabbed the LaBiancas and smeared the couple\u2019s blood on the walls. The day before, other Manson followers, not including Van Houten, killed pregnant actress Sharon Tate and four others. In his rejection letter, Newsom noted that Van Housen had undergone therapy, earned educational degrees and taken self-help classes in prison and had shown \u201cincreased maturity and rehabilitation.\u201d But Van Houten also has \u201cgaps in insight\u201d that continue to make her a danger to society, Newsom said. Van Houten has had 21 parole hearings since 1982. Most parole boards denied her bid for freedom. But five panels have recommended her release since 2016, saying she had expressed remorse and was no longer a threat to public safety. Newsom rejected a recommendation made last November, and previously reversed parole recommendations in 2019 and 2020. In February, the California Supreme Court refused to hear Van Houten\u2019s appeal of the 2020 rejection. \u2014 What we are watching in the rest of the world \u2026 KYIV, Ukraine _ Russia\u2019s pledge to scale back some military operations in Ukraine drew skepticism even as the two nations planned to return Wednesday to talks that could produce a framework for ending the war that has imposed an increasingly punishing toll. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said there was no reason to believe Russia\u2019s announcement that it would reduce military activity near Kyiv, the capital, as well as in the northern city of Chernihiv, given what\u2019s still happening on the ground. \u201cWe can call those signals that we hear at the negotiations positive,\u201d he said in his nightly video address to the Ukrainian people. \u201cBut those signals don\u2019t silence the explosions of Russian shells.\u201d It was a bitter reality check in a rare moment of optimism five weeks into what has devolved into a bloody war of attrition, with thousands dead and almost 4 million Ukrainians fleeing the country. Earlier Tuesday, Ukraine\u2019s delegation at the conference, held in Istanbul, laid out a framework under which the country would declare itself neutral and its security would be guaranteed by an array of other nations. Moscow\u2019s public reaction was positive, and the negotiations were expected to resume Wednesday in Istanbul. Meanwhile, Germany triggered an early warning level for natural gas supplies and called on consumers to save energy amid concerns that Russia could cut off deliveries unless it is paid in rubles. Western nations have rejected the Russian demand for ruble payments, arguing it would undermine the sanctions imposed against Moscow over the war in Ukraine. \u2014 On this day in 1972 \u2026 Canadian sailors got a daily rum ration for the last time, ending a navy tradition dating back to 1667. \u2014 In entertainment \u2026 NEW YORK _ Foo Fighters have cancelled all upcoming concert dates following the death of the band\u2019s drummer, Taylor Hawkins. The rockers had been scheduled to play at the Grammy Awards in Las Vegas on Sunday as well as spring dates at the Beale Street Music Festival; the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival; Columbia, Maryland; Raleigh, North Carolina; Daytona Beach; Charlotte, North Carolina; the Boston Calling Music Festival; and summer dates in Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, France and the UK. \u201cIt is with great sadness that Foo Fighters confirm the cancellation of all upcoming tour dates in light of the staggering loss of our brother,\u201d the band said in a statement Tuesday. Hawkins died Friday during a South American tour with the rock band. He was 50. \u201cWe\u2019re sorry for and share in the disappointment that we won\u2019t be seeing one another as planned,\u201d the band\u2019s statement read. \u201cInstead, let\u2019s take this time to grieve, to heal, to pull our loved ones close, and to appreciate all the music and memories we\u2019ve made together.\u201d Hawkins was Alanis Morissette\u2019s touring drummer when he joined Foo Fighters in 1997. He played on the band\u2019s biggest albums including \u201cOne by One\u201d and \u201cIn Your Honor,\u201d and on hit singles like \u201cBest of You.\u201d In lead singer David Grohl\u2019s 2021 book \u201cThe Storyteller,\u201d he called Hawkins his \u201cbrother from another mother, my best friend, a man for whom I would take a bullet.\u201d \u2014 Did you see this? OTTAWA _ Canada\u2019s Conservatives continue to reject the target the Liberal government set for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, as the party searches for a new leader who will decide its approach to tackle climate change. On Tuesday, the federal government released its plan for how it hopes to achieve its latest goal, which is to cut carbon-related pollution by 40 to 45 per cent from 2005 levels by the end of the decade. Tory environment critic Kyle Seeback says the party doesn\u2019t support that plan.

            "description": "DYSON has launched its first pair of noise-cancelling headphones ...that also clean pollution, allergens and viruses from the air around you.",
            "full_description": "Dyson Zone is a one-of-a-kind pair of noise-cancelling headphones that purify the air that you breathe. Just like Dyson's line of hugely-popular freestanding air purifiers for the home, the Dyson Zone removes air pollution and even airborne viruses. Combined with the wireless noise-cancellation headlines, Dyson says its new headphones are designed to simultaneously tackle \"the urban issues of air quality and noise pollution\". It has taken more than six years and 500 prototypes \u2013 all developed in secret within Dyson's laboratories \u2013 to finalise the design of the Zone. A dizzying number of engineering problems could've sunk the idea: miniaturising the compressors so they can be worn, ensuring the components are lightweight that it doesn't put strain on your neck, guaranteeing the noise created by the air purifying process doesn't ruin your listening experience, eking out enough battery life so the Zone can be used for hours ...the list goes on. However, Dyson believes that it's finally time to unveil the Zone to the world, with sales set to start later this year. And the introduction of this never-before-seen product is pretty timely. The World Health Organisation (WHO) now estimates that 9 in 10 people globally breathe air that exceeds what it recommends as guideline pollutant limits. While NO2 pollution in cities did decrease dramatically during the lockdowns triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, levels have quickly returned to normal \u2013 or in some cases, exceeded pre-pandemic levels across global cities. In January 2022, for the first time, people living in London were advised not to exercise outdoors due to high levels of pollution. Jake Dyson, Chief Engineer said: \u201cAir pollution is a global problem \u2013 it affects us everywhere we go. In our homes, at school, at work and as we travel, whether on foot, on a bike or by public or private transport. The Dyson Zone purifies the air you breathe on the move. And unlike face masks, it delivers a plume of fresh air without touching your face, using high-performance filters and two miniaturised air pumps. After six years in development, we\u2019re excited to deliver pure air and pure audio, anywhere.\u201d How does the Dyson Zone work? Compressors within the earcups of the headphones draw air through dual-layer filters, designed from the ground-up to fit within the considerable space constraints of a headphone. A negatively charged electrostatic filter media captures ultrafine particles such as allergens, and particles from sources such as brake dust, industry combustion, and construction. This system is capable of capturing 99 percent of particle pollution as small as 0.1 microns, such as dust, pollen and bacteria. For context, Covid-19 virus particles on average measure 0.12 microns. Dyson has also fitted a potassium-enriched carbon layer that captures city gas pollutants like NO2 and SO2. Cleaned from pollutants, allergens and viruses, the air is then funnelled through the visor. Crucially, this doesn't sit on your nose and mouth, like a snorkel, but instead freely floats just in front of you. Accelerometers within the headphones measure the amount of movement and automatically adjust the amount of airflow accordingly \u2013 so, if you start vigorously jogging to catch the last train, the amount of purified air will increase dramatically to meet your needs, before slowing again as you settle down into your seat. You can manually change the air purification between low, medium and high too using a button on the back of the earcup. The geometries of the visor, combined with a central mesh that diffuses the two jets of airflow, are designed to ensure that purified air will always reach you, even when walking in strong crosswinds. Dyson says the visor is designed to cater to all facial shapes too. The visor is made of flexible plastic and can be removed if you want to continue using the headphones without the air purifier system. It attaches to the earcups with powerful magnets. Cleverly, the visor can also be dipped \u2013 so that it sits under your chin. This automatically turns off the purification to conserve battery power (not to mention that cleaned air would be uselessly fired into your jawline) so that you can have a quick conversation with someone, drink or eat, before going on your way. Registering your new Dyson Zone within the existing Dyson smartphone app, the company will use your current location to estimate the levels of pollution and suggest when you'll need to replace the filters in the earcups of your headphones. For those living in the UK, Dyson believes a refresh once-a-year will be enough to shield wearers from pollutants. And what about the noise-cancellation? Dyson Zone uses active noise-cancellation to cancel out any background sounds that might ruin your favourite track, podcast, or audiobook. Dyson has fitted the headphones with a number of microphones \u2013 including one dedicated to measuring the amount of noise emanating from the motors in the earcups fuelling the air filtration \u2013 to determine the low-frequency noise. A second frequency, phase-inverted by 180 degrees, is then played alongside your tunes or podcasts to neutralise all unwanted sounds before they reach your ear. As a result, you'll be able listen at much lower volumes, even in loud environments like aeroplanes, trains, trams, and sat beside the photocopier in the office. Just like a pair of conventional noise-cancellation headphones, Dyson has fitted a number of modes. First up, \"Isolation Mode\" relies on the highest level of active noise cancellation to provide an immersive audio experience that strips out any distracting background noise from the world around you, \"Conversation Mode\" kicks in automatically when you dip the visor and uses software to amplify voices so that you can have a natural conversation with someone without removing the Dyson Zone, and finally, \"Transparency Mode\" is designed to ensure you're aware of all of your surroundings \u2013 it amplifies key sounds like emergency service sirens or informational announcements over the tannoy in airports and train stations. Dyson says that \u2013 like all of its products \u2013 the Dyson Zone air-purifying headphones were tested to the extremes during the development process. Teams working from the UK, Singapore, Malaysia, and China used temperature-controlled chambers, drop-tests, material and fabric wear testing, button robustness, and more to ensure the Dyson Zone to live-up to the strains of day-to-day life. The Dyson Zone air-purifying headphones will be available to buy online and in-store at Dyson Demo Stores and Dyson.co.uk from Autumn 2022. There's no word on an exact UK release date ...nor any price. However, stay tuned for more information of these truly unique headphones in the coming weeks.",

Meanwhile, no casualty has been reported so far although the fire continues to burn for the last 48 hours as the firefighters are not able to reach the heights of the garbage dumps. Informing the media, the fire department informed that efforts are ongoing by taking effective measures to stop the flames which might take a little longer to be done with the cooling operations.

Called the Dyson Zone, the wearable device combines noise-cancelling over-ear headphones with a visor that sits just in front of the nose and mouth, delivering filtered air. The British technology firm said the headphones have been created in response to growing concerns about air and sound pollution in urban areas.

Maybe it would be one of those wearable hair dryers, or some kind of styling hat you wore to sleep and then woke up with your hair in soft ringlets. Even a normal pair of headphones would make sense because Dyson is in the business of moving air, and sound is basically just air moving in specific ways. If you guessed that last one, you would be kind of right. It\u2019s a pair of noise cancelling headphones with a large battery that powers a personal air purifying visor that looks like it leapt off the screen from a Mad Max/Power Rangers crossover. The closest real world gadget I can compare it to is the PediSedate GameBoy peripheral that sedated children before medical procedures. window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_1_mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); If your initial reaction to The Dyson Zone is the less PG version of \u201cwhat the frilly heck is this\u201d, I need you to know that I watched the briefing presentation in a room by myself a month ago and signed an NDA to not talk about it. Not talking about it has caused near physical pain. I have been writing about technology for roughly 15 years and this is the craziest device I have ever seen a major company launch. I can\u2019t believe this exists and is a real thing. It\u2019s amazing. People will buy and wear these in public. Hell, I will probably buy and wear one of these in public. Someone wearing it in public. Image: Matt Alexander/PA wire (courtesy of Dyson) The reason why the ear cups are so large is to house the batteries that make the whole thing work. The battery life for audio+ANC only is 40 hours, audio and low purification gets you 4.5 hours, and you can use them plugged into power to get you through a long flight. They charge using a USB-C port on the left ear cup. They\u2019ve got 11 microphones, nine for noise cancellation and two for phone calls. You can wear the headphones without the visor, but you need the headphones to use the visor. The filter is replaceable and will need to be switched out roughly every 12 months. It is not designed to be worn by children. I\u2019m torn because I love air purifiers and headphones. I collect headphones and they\u2019re the gadget that first made me fall in love with gadgets. And, since I have the asthma and allergies of one of those inbred English royals, I am extremely interested in air purifiers and have always wanted a portable one. Imagine never again having to walk into a cloud of Lynx spray and desperation without protection? I just never imagined the two devices being combined this early and it\u2019s making the apocalypse seem awfully nigh. Dyson went through many iterations to land on the one that\u2019s going to shops. Personally, I prefer the Murex shell-shaped ear cups, they add a sense of whimsy. Image: Dyson If you\u2019re thinking this will be a good alternative to pandemic face masks, think again. The Dyson Zone wasn\u2019t designed for the pandemic, and has in fact been in the works for the last six years. Fun fact: the original design was apparently a kind of backpack and snorkel combination, and it took 500 prototypes to get to this version. Less Hannibal-like when photographed this way. Image: Dyson window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_1_hpu-mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); Wearing a mask during the COVID-19 pandemic and flu season more broadly is to protect other people from you potentially carrying and spreading the virus without knowing, while this purifier only protects you from other people. Put simply, the air that goes into your face has been purified, the air that comes out of your face is someone else\u2019s problem. The good news, though, is that there is a P2 mask attachment that clips into the purifying visor so you can have fresh, purified air pumped into your protective mask. It\u2019s a game changer for people in very high-risk groups (like people with cancer, autoimmune diseases, or anaemia), but also makes this device seem even more dystopian. Potentially lifesaving, but still one of those moments where you need to stop and ask how we came to this point as a species. Meet Frank. Image: Dyson The Dyson Zone was created and tested on a mannequin named Frank, who kind of looks like the love child of Aang from Avatar: The Last Air Bender and Vision from the MCU (by which I mean he\u2019s bald and has a strip of sensors on his face). Frank has a set of mechanical lungs and can mimic the human breathing profile. To see how The Dyson Zone reacted to a variety of real-world situations, they put Frank in a wind tunnel and then blasted polluted air at him. According to the briefing, the Zone did a good job of protecting Frank from most of the pollution, so that\u2019s a good sign. The Dyson Zone\u2019s purpose is to help people with the problem of air pollution and noise pollution, which plague roughly 90 per cent of the world\u2019s population. This is a really important problem to solve because, according to the WHO, 4.2 million people die as a result of poor outdoor air quality each year, which is horrifying. This will be fantastic in areas with high pollution, like parts of India and China, and even Australia during bushfire season. window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_2_mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); Another good option would be to lobby governments around the world to put in stronger environmental protections and stop letting major corporations pollute the Earth and make it hazardous to the health of billions of people. However, if that\u2019s not an option, an expensive headset using plastic and rare Earth materials, so rich people can still breathe, making fresh air a luxury item, is a solid plan B. Jokes about our impending, climate change-related deaths aside, if you can get past the appearance, a device like this really does stand a chance of helping vulnerable people who can afford it. This isn\u2019t the first air purification mask, Razer did release one last year, but this is the first time portable air purification has gone mainstream. Image: Dyson That said, do you think they had tech reviews of the Stillsuits and masks in the world of Dune? Was there some kind of tech reviewer in that universe laughing at the absurdity of it all before those things became essential to their survival while they wrote up the announcement piece? When the House of El realised Krypton was doomed, did they also sell masks like this? The Dyson Zone seems like a great product, as someone who relies on noise cancelling headphones in crowds, and also relies heavily on air purifiers at home (I\u2019ve seen the difference they made to my family\u2019s asthma), I really want one of these. I just wish their existence didn\u2019t feel like the next step towards the apocalypse due to widespread inaction on climate change. Dyson says The Dyson Zone will be available in stores in the second half of 2022, and we\u2019ll bring you a review as soon as we can. Pricing has not been announced yet.

To prevent crosswinds from introducing polluted air into the visor, sculpted returns keep the purified air close to the wearer's nose and mouth. </p><p>The level of purification can even automatically adapt to what you're doing, with four different modes: low, medium, high, and Auto. In Auto mode, accelerometers in the headphones detect your movements and toggle between high, medium, and low purification speeds \u2013 so, if you're running and breathing heavily, the Dyson Zone will up the level of purification.</p><p>Dyson has taken the same scientific approach to the development of the <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/audio/portable-audio/best-over-ear-headphones-1280342\">over-ear headphones</a>' audio performance, using a team of audio engineers and acousticians to engineer \"excellent audio led by metrics, backed up with extensive listening trials\".

            "full_description": "Dyson has revealed the strangest headphones we've ever seen, combining a pair of over-ear noise-cancellers with a pollution-beating mask that filters the air you breathe. The Dyson Zone air-purifying headphones are designed to capture city pollution, such as gas, allergens, and particulate matter, while blocking out unwanted noise with ANC and what the company describes as \"pure, high-fidelity audio\". Building on the company's 30-year history of developing airflow, filtration, and motor technology, the headphones contain compressors in each earcup that draw air through dual-layer filters, and then project two streams of purified air to the wearer's nose and mouth. The visor-like mask element of the headphones isn't totally closed off like a surgical mask and doesn't actually come into contact with the wearer's face, avoiding irritation and discomfort. To prevent crosswinds from introducing polluted air into the visor, sculpted returns keep the purified air close to the wearer's nose and mouth. The level of purification can even automatically adapt to what you're doing, with four different modes: low, medium, high, and Auto. In Auto mode, accelerometers in the headphones detect your movements and toggle between high, medium, and low purification speeds \u2013 so, if you're running and breathing heavily, the Dyson Zone will up the level of purification. Dyson has taken the same scientific approach to the development of the over-ear headphones ' audio performance, using a team of audio engineers and acousticians to engineer \"excellent audio led by metrics, backed up with extensive listening trials\". According to the company, the result is a wide frequency response, precise left-right balance, and low distortion, with neodymium drivers delivering \"a faithful reproduction as the musicians or creators intended\". To preserve audio quality and to allow listeners to enjoy their music uninterrupted, the air-purifying headphones use a mixture of passive and active noise cancellation, with large angled ear cushions that mold around the user's ears. And, if you just want to listen to music, you can remove the visor entirely and use the Zone purely as a pair of wireless headphones . There are three ANC modes, including Isolation, Conversation, and Transparency. Isolation blocks out the most ambient sound, while Transparency mode amplifies \"key sounds like emergency service sirens of informational announcements\", in a similar way to the Sony WH-1000X4 . Conversation mode is activated any time you dip the visor, and it automatically turns off the air purification and amplifies the sound of voices. As well as being Dyson's first audio device, the Zone noise-cancelling headphones are the brand's first wearable \u2013 and as such, the company has made a huge effort to ensure they're comfortable. The headphones take inspiration from the shape and design of a horse's saddle, in that they are engineered to distribute weight over the sides of the head, rather than the top \u2013 much like a saddle curves over the horse's spine and distributes the load over the areas left and right of the backbone. While the air-purifying headphones could be seen as a response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Dyson Zone headphones have been in development for six years, and are focused on tackling urban pollution, which chief engineer Jake Dyson describes as a \"global problem\". Even if you did want to use the air-purifying headphones to prevent Covid-19 infection, the filter used by the Dyson Zone won't be sufficient. The company says it's capable of filtering out 99% of particle pollution as small as 0.1 microns, such as dust, pollen, and bacteria. Viruses, including coronaviruses, are much smaller than that .

            "description": "Dyson just unveiled its first wearable product and\u2026 it\u2019s not what you think it is. The device is called the Dyson Zone, and it's a set of noise-canceling, air-purifying headphones. It comes with a detachable visor for the bottom half of the wearer\u2019s face that looks, to put it mildly, odd. That vizor actually blows filtered air to your nose, mouth and chin, sort of like a portable fan dedicated to the lower portion of your face. Dyson integrated a smaller version of its air filtration system into the earcups, and the idea is that people can protect themselves from pollution while out and about.The Zone might seem like a response to the pandemic, but Dyson says this device has actually been six years in the making. It\u2019s not borne from a desire to keep out COVID-19 germs, per se, and more as a means to help people breathe less-polluted air wherever they go. The Zone is not only a wearable air filtration system, but it\u2019s also the company\u2019s first audio product. In fact, Dyson describes it as \u201cheadphones delivering pure air and pure sound.\u201dIf you\u2019re thinking this thing looks absurd, you\u2019re not alone. My first reaction to seeing the Zone on a mannequin\u2019s head during a virtual briefing was complete and utter amusement. Shortly after, I saw it on an actual person on the demo call and it did not look like they were enjoying themselves. So when Dyson offered to show the contraption to me in person, I knew I had to see and try this thing out for myself. Sadly, I wasn\u2019t allowed to take any photos or video of the Zone, so I\u2019ll do my best to describe the experience.\u00a0DysonMy biggest takeaway after spending some time with a prototype is that, yes, it does look just as ridiculous in real life. But somehow, in spite of its wild appearance, I still really want one. Dyson said it engineered the headset to fit comfortably and distribute weight evenly, by drawing inspiration from horse saddles. There are three cushions on the headband, and the central one is slightly curved like a saddle to distribute the load through \u201ccontact areas.\u201dWhen I put on the Zone and adjusted its arms to fit my head, it felt balanced and didn\u2019t feel heavy. The earcups themselves were spongy and soft, and once they clamped on there was a noticeable noise canceling effect. That\u2019s because the demo unit had already been set to enable active noise canceling when it\u2019s worn. By clicking through a physical switch on the earcup, I toggled through different sound profiles, and though I occasionally heard some static, the pass-through and complete cancellation modes were effective.\u00a0Three ANC modes are available: Isolation, Conversation and Transparency. Isolation provides the highest level of muffling, while Conversation, which kicks in when you dip the visor, turns off the filtration motors to let you better hear who you\u2019re talking to. Transparency allows certain sounds to pass through, so you can be aware of your surroundings.For an initial foray into the audio space, the Zone is impressively satisfying. A company rep streamed Spotify to the demo unit and I enjoyed the ample bass and clear sound in songs like Doja Cat\u2019s Say So.DysonThe highlight of my time with the Zone, though, has got to be when I snapped the magnetic visor on. After I figured out where on the headphones to aim the edges, taking the attachment on and off was easy. Once the mask was connected, the motors in the earcups whirred to life and a gentle, clean-smelling trickle of air started blowing at my lips and nose. It was surprisingly comfortable and, for an obsessive clean freak like me, felt borderline magical. This could not only be the personal air bubble I\u2019ve dreamed of, but also might be a portable air conditioner for the lower half of my face, which would be a blessing in the summer.Four air purification modes are available as well \u2014 low, medium, high and auto. You can toggle these to, say, use the maximum level when you need a higher purification speed if you\u2019re breathing rapidly during a quick jog on the streets. For the Auto mode, the Zone will use onboard accelerometers to determine which setting to choose.The visor was also designed to diffuse two jets of airflow and at no point during my time with the Dyson Zone did I feel like I was being overwhelmed or pummeled by wind. The earcup\u2019s compressors draw air through dual-layer filters, including negatively charged electrostatic filters to catch particles like allergens and dust. A potassium-enriched carbon layer captures gas pollutants like nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide and ozone.Earlier versions of the Zone took the form of a snorkel-like mouthpiece connected to a backpack (like oxygen tanks in a scuba diving setup). 500 prototypes later, the company settled on the headset and visor combination, and the mouthpiece can deliver clean air without touching the wearer\u2019s face. \u201cDeveloping a non-contact solution was a must for Dyson engineers, to avoid the discomfort and irritation often associated with full-contact alternatives,\u201d the company said in a statement.\u00a0DysonIt does leave room for you to insert a face mask, though, and Dyson provides attachments for coverings that would meet FFP2 filtration standards in the box. It also includes a \u201ccommunity face covering attachment\u201d that would form a \u201csealed solution\u201d so you can mask up while keeping your filtered air clean.Dyson also made a companion app that shows the air quality of the region you\u2019re in, though at the time of the demo it didn\u2019t offer information that was more location-specific than a city. You couldn\u2019t, for instance, see if your place of work had more air pollutants than the park you\u2019d walk to for lunch.The company hasn\u2019t shared pricing and availability information for the Zone just yet, other than to say it\u2019s coming this year. I can already see this being a great device for my future travels \u2014 whether in an airplane or a commuter train, and at the demo I even went to lay down on a couch to see how comfortable the Zone would be to wear on a redeye flight. It felt surprisingly comfortable for the admittedly brief period of time I was lying down. But of course, there are still things I\u2019d need to know before spending money on the Zone \u2014 like battery life and real-world performance. Hopefully, Dyson will share more information on those things soon.",

It does this using two motors that sit inside the earcups.</p><p>The visor that provides the air purification also comes with in-the-box add-ons to modify it for different scenarios. There\u2019s the regulator visor, a face-covering attachment that forms a seal around your face, and an FFP2-compliant face covering to meet certain filtration standards.</p><p>The Zone will offer four air-purifying modes: Low, Medium, High, and Auto. As the headphones are designed with fitness in mind, the Auto mode will automatically switch between the different settings based on the information from the onboard accelerometers. So, if you're running and breathing heavily, the Zone will toggle to the High setting to filter air more quickly as you inhale and exhale rapidly.</p><p>If you want to focus on the music and don\u2019t need the air purification at all, then the visor can be detached.</p> <figure data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\"><img id=\"fh2MCNRyULUybvjuMpLyxi\" name=\"New Project (3).jpg\" alt=\"Dyson Zone\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fh2MCNRyULUybvjuMpLyxi.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" ><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Dyson)</span></figcaption></figure> <h3 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-dyson-zone-battery-life\"><span>Dyson Zone: battery life</span></h3> <p>We don\u2019t yet have any details about battery life, but we suspect it could sit toward the lower end of the scale \u2013 especially if you have ANC and air-purifying settings turned up as high as they\u2019ll go. </p><p>As such, we'd be surprised if these cans could boast a battery life longer than 10 hours under these conditions.

While they\u2019re still several months from release, Dyson is already making some big promises about the capabilities of the Dyson Zone headphones. The company claims that the Zone will deliver an audio performance to rival some of the best headphones out there as well as a mask that could outpace the Razer Zephyr in terms of fashion and function. Here\u2019s everything we know about the Dyson Zone air-purifying headphones so far. Dyson hasn\u2019t yet released the pricing of its Dyson Zone air-purifying, noise-cancelling headphones, but we suspect they\u2019ll cost a fair bit more than your standard pair of cans. Dyson air purifiers typically start at around $400 / \u00a3350 / AU$600. However, as the Zone are much more unique and feature-heavy than a regular air purifier, we could see Dyson charging a fair bit more for it. Considering that you could pick up the best noise-cancelling headphones out there (the Sony WH-1000XM4 ) for $349.99 / \u00a3349 / AU$549 at launch, it wouldn\u2019t surprise us if Dyson\u2019s first headphones come in at around $500 / \u00a3450 / $650. We\u2019ll have to wait and see what the company has in store for us, though. While Dyson hasn\u2019t given us a firm release date it has said that the new Dyson Zone headphones will be available online and in-store in \"Autumn 2022\" (that\u2019s Autumn in the Northern Hemisphere so September through November). Given the world\u2019s ongoing shipping and manufacturing issues, we suspect Dyson will leave us waiting for a more specific release date for a while. We\u2019ll be sure to keep you up to date with everything as we hear it, but you can also register your interest at Dyson US or Dyson UK if you want to be sure you\u2019re as up-to-date as possible. The Dyson Zone are set to offer a mix of premium features for audiophiles and the health-conscious alike. While we haven\u2019t been able to test these headphones for ourselves to verify the claims, Dyson is already making bold promises about the audio performance the Zone can deliver. Specifically, it says that the device\u2019s \u201chigh performing neodymium electroacoustic system\u201d can deliver audio as the artist intended. This likely means high-fidelity (or lossless ) audio support, and potentially some form of spatial audio support to create a realistic soundstage \u2013 again, though, we\u2019ll have to wait and see. Much like other noise-cancelling cans, the Dyson Zone will have three options: Isolation, Conversation, and Transparency. Isolation, as you can guess from the name, will be the highest level of noise cancellation, for when you want a fully immersive audio experience. Conversation mode is switched on when you pull down the air-purifying visor; the air purification will switch off and the voices around you will be amplified. Lastly, Transparency mode will let you stay aware of your environment - it's designed to amplify key sounds like emergency service sirens or informational announcements. As for air purification, Dyson says that the Zone can capture 99% of particle pollution including dust, pollen, and bacteria, and can filter city gasses like NO2, SO2, and O3. It does this using two motors that sit inside the earcups. The visor that provides the air purification also comes with in-the-box add-ons to modify it for different scenarios. There\u2019s the regulator visor, a face-covering attachment that forms a seal around your face, and an FFP2-compliant face covering to meet certain filtration standards. The Zone will offer four air-purifying modes: Low, Medium, High, and Auto. As the headphones are designed with fitness in mind, the Auto mode will automatically switch between the different settings based on the information from the onboard accelerometers. So, if you're running and breathing heavily, the Zone will toggle to the High setting to filter air more quickly as you inhale and exhale rapidly. If you want to focus on the music and don\u2019t need the air purification at all, then the visor can be detached. We don\u2019t yet have any details about battery life, but we suspect it could sit toward the lower end of the scale \u2013 especially if you have ANC and air-purifying settings turned up as high as they\u2019ll go. As such, we'd be surprised if these cans could boast a battery life longer than 10 hours under these conditions. That said, with the visor detached and ANC off you might see a performance that's more in line with regular wireless headphones like the Sony WH-1000XM4, which offer up to 38 hours of playback. We'll just have to see what Dyson announces as we get closer to the release date.",

            "description": "After 6 years and 500 prototypes, will Dyson\u2019s radical clean-air blowing ANC headphones change the way people live or look like a joke?",
            "full_description": "No, this is not an elaborate April fool. This is the Dyson Zone, a personal air-purifying mask and noise-canceling headphone doohickey that started life well before the Covid-19 pandemic made masks mainstream. Available globally sometime next autumn, the Zone has taken six years to develop and represents either a bold new world of personal pollution protection or an economic and PR disaster for Dyson. Frankly, we're not sure which it will be. It\u2019s a head-mounted, fan-powered, personal air purifier with over-ear headphones, obviously. On each ear a brilliantly engineered miniature fan\u2014essentially a shrunken version of the type found on the brand's Cool and Hot range of home air purifiers\u2014sucks in dirty air, trapping the nasty stuff in an elaborate series of filters, before squirting a smooth stream of clean air across the wearer\u2019s mouth and nose. The reasoning behind the Dyson Zone is a somber one. Globally, air pollution kills an estimated 7 million people every year. Data from the World Health Organization shows that 99 percent of the global population breathes air that exceeds guideline limits on pollution, with, unsurprisingly, low- and middle-income countries suffering from the highest exposures. According to the Global Alliance on Health and Pollution , both China and India suffer from over 1.2 million air-pollution-related deaths each year, while Public Health England states that air pollution is the biggest environmental threat to health in the UK, with 28,000 to 36,000 deaths a year attributed to long-term exposure. In short, our air quality is killing us. But if you pop on a Dyson Zone before heading outside it will filter the air to 0.1 micron particles and capture 99 percent of those 0.1 micron particles, which is as close to clean as you can get. Undoing the atmospheric damage caused by centuries of unchecked industrialization was never going to be easy. Encouraging the uptake of low-emission vehicles, aggressive levies on antiquated industrial practices, investment in public transport infrastructure, citywide reengineering, and rapidly evolving tech innovation will all help, but why bother when a personal air-filtration device can keep you healthy? Getting back to the product, the chrome-effect plastic mouthpiece sits away from your face, making it significantly more comfortable than a traditional face mask, and, fortunately, it can be pulled down quickly if you need to talk to someone. And, despite its considerable size, the whole unit is surprisingly well balanced and comfortable to wear\u2014though we have not tried the Zone for periods longer than a few minutes. How does it work? Two tiny precision-engineered compressors within each ear cup draw air through dual-layer filters. The negatively charged electrostatic filters capture ultrafine particles such as allergens, while a potassium-enriched carbon layer grabs gas pollutants like nitrogen dioxide and Sulfur dioxide. It is a typically Dysonesque feat of engineering, and the execution\u2014if not the aesthetics\u2014is impressive. The Zone has four air-purification settings, including Auto, which uses onboard accelerometers to judge how fast you need your clean air delivered. It\u2019s worth noting that, despite pumping perfectly clean air over your face, the Zone is not a replacement for a surgical face mask, but Dyson is supplying a face covering attachment (we didn\u2019t get to see this) that forms a seal and meets FFP2 filtration standards. As for the headphones, behind the fans and filters Dyson has squeezed a neodymium electroacoustic driver, with multilevel active noise cancellation and all the features we\u2019ve come to expect, including mics for calling, ambient pass-through modes, and app-based EQ tweaking. But why combine headphones and air purification? Because those fans stuck to the side of your head are noisy, and without the ANC you\u2019ll hear nothing but a whir in your ear. Dyson readily admits it\u2019s a problem of its own creation, and as a result the ANC and passive noise isolation on the Zone seems (in our limited preview) impressive, and you can barely, if at all, hear the fans while wearing them. It\u2019s an entirely different situation, however, for the person sitting next to you. Who cares though? This is personal protection, and to hell with the rest of the population. It\u2019s a case of, \u2018I\u2019m all right, Jack,\u2019 or maybe, given the chief engineer involved, that should be Jake? The Zone is Jake Dyson 's baby, apparently. Jake is James Dyson\u2019s son, and he designed the company's innovative CSYS desk lamp . In the few minutes we had with the Dyson Zone, we could tell the headphones were well made, but the sound performance was definitely on the safe side. Neutral, if you\u2019d prefer. The ANC didn\u2019t seem to cloud the music like it often can, but we weren\u2019t bowled over by the majesty of the audio. Given these headphones are designed to be your go-to commuter pair, we hoped for more\u2014but we'll hold off judgment for a full review. They\u2019re functional, too, and if you don\u2019t care about sonic subtleties\u2014and many don\u2019t\u2014they\u2019ll be fine. Interestingly, Dyson says it tuned the headphones using a purely data-driven set of factors\u2014based around the Harman curve \u2014rather than going on feel or calling on the services of an audio expert, or \u201cgolden listener\u201d as they call it. Not asking for outside help is a classic Dyson move, but maybe having just good headphones is enough here, when their primary job is to block out the sound of the fans. Dyson actually based the design of the Zone's headband on a horse\u2019s saddle, with weight positioned over the sides of the head rather than on the top. It\u2019s a neat engineering solution that could make all the difference on long journeys. The user can remove the mouthpiece and just listen to the headphones, which is a smart move, but these cans are huge and look more like a pair of listen-at-home headphones than an everyday commuter pair. Would we buy them as headphones? No. \u201cPolarizing\u201d is the polite word here when describing the Zone. Be honest: When you first saw the pictures above, what did you think? Our initial outward reaction was one of guarded bemusement, but inside we were astonished, and not in a good way. Six years\u2019 development and a global pandemic, and this is the answer? It looks like chrome-effect plastic Ant Man mask. And that's the PG rating. Some people's minds may well wander toward darker territories. But as time went on we started to wonder how often you would need to see someone wearing a Dyson Zone for it to become normal. Yes it\u2019s big, bold, and plenty bonkers, but we\u2019re all used to masks now, so what\u2019s the difference? While reserved Brits and Americans might take a bit\u2014OK, a lot\u2014of persuasion, we can imagine the uptake in Asia to be more gung ho, especially as the air pollution is significantly worse in Beijing than in Birminghams on either side of the Atlantic. Remember when nobody wore ski helmets (or bike helmets for that matter)? Yet in just a few years they became ubiquitous. It doesn\u2019t take long to change what normal looks like, but is the Dyson Zone the product to change the way we think about personal air quality? If it was built into a cycling or motorbike helmet, then sign us up, but for now we\u2019re not quite thirsty enough to drink the Dyson Kool-Aid. What\u2019s also interesting is that Dyson described the Zone as a first-to-market product. This might have been true six years ago, but in the post-pandemic, mask-wearing world, this innovation is now far from unique. Will.i.am\u2019s $300 Bluetooth-headphone-toting, fan-powered Xupermask launched\u2014with a fair few sideways glances and the odd giggle\u2014in April 2021; LG\u2019s PuriCare personal air purifier was teased even earlier, at the International Franchise Association\u2019s 2020 convention. Since then Respiray has launched a personal clean-air device, Atmoblue\u2019s mask promises fresh air on demand, and Air Ring\u2019s private atmosphere-generating, shoulder-mounted mask pumps clean air right into your face. Yes, many of these devices will have limited releases, and some may, cynically, be little more than bandwagon-jumping pandemic marketing exercises, but Dyson is promising a global launch of the Zone, which, given its typical product launch spend, pretty much guarantees that most people in affluent society will know about it. And let us not forget that Dyson is a brand founded on reinvention , not invention. It has transformed the vacuum cleaner, the air purifier and the hair dryer, even the wheelbarrow, and has reimagined the table lamp for the LED generation\u2014but all of these products were well established categories before Dyson tucked into them. Six years ago, personal air purification wasn\u2019t a thing, but Dyson saw a gap in the market and went all in. It isn\u2019t, and never was, designed to protect from disease, but can you imagine the Dyson Zone existing in a world that hasn\u2019t been through a global airborne pandemic? Despite a frankly startling design that can at best be described as \u201cpolarizing,\u201d the apparent lack of established audio know-how, and, by Dyson's own admission, no consumer-focus-group testing on the product whatsoever (in other words, Dyson doesn't know people want the Zone, it just assumes they do), we have another fundamental issue with these health-tech headphones: their price. Dyson has refused point blank to talk pricing on the Zone. We have no idea what a pair will cost. But considering the years of development, the complex mechanics, the patents developed, and the sheer cost of making something in a completely new category, these will not be cheap. If you balk at spending $350 on some Sony WH-1000XM4s, then these will surely be more expensive. They will likely cost more than the $550 AirPods Max, too. In short, the goal here of providing portable clean air for us to breathe as we callously continue to pollute our planet is laudable. But the Zone looks very much like it's clean air for the rich, for the comfortable, for those who likely have access to preferable environmental conditions already. And that's a thought almost as uncomfortable as looking in the mirror wearing these headphones.",

It\u2019s both the strangest and most ambitious product that the company has ever made. Today\u2019s announcement is just an initial reveal of the Zone headphones ahead of a fall release date, and Dyson isn\u2019t announcing specific details like price or specifications (including how much the headphones weigh or how long the battery will last) at this time. The goal of the Zone is to make living in urban spaces more comfortable by attempting to mitigate both air and noise pollution. No word on price yet The air purification half of the Zone doesn\u2019t reinvent the wheel for Dyson. Instead, it miniaturizes the company\u2019s existing air filtration technology into a unique form factor. The Zone pulls in air through each earpiece using a pair of tiny compressors. The air is then filtered and piped through the (slightly bizarre-looking) \u201cvisor\u201d for the user to breathe in \u2014 sans most of the particles and pollutants. Despite what it looks like, the visor doesn\u2019t make contact with your face like a mask would. Instead, it sits in front of your face, creating a gap where a bubble of clean air can gather and be breathed in. (The company showed off a separate attachment that could be clipped on in instances where you might need a proper full-contact face mask, too.) Image: Dyson The Dyson Zone on the company\u2019s testing platform, Frank. The visor snaps on through a series of magnets, allowing for it to be removed if you just want to use the headphones as headphones. It also has hinges that flip it down so that you can talk to people normally without having to take off the whole apparatus. The Zone\u2019s filtration system also offers multiple settings for different levels of exertion. For example, if you\u2019re running up a flight of stairs or trying to catch a bus, you\u2019ll breathe heavier (and need more air) than if you\u2019re on a leisurely stroll. There\u2019s even an automated setting that uses accelerometers to automatically adjust the airflow. The mask is removable, and flips down for \u201cconversation\u201d mode Dyson says the Zone can filter out up to 99 percent of particle pollution \u2014 although the filters aren\u2019t reusable and will need to be replaced after about a year. (The company says the exact amount of time will depend on how much air pollution you encounter and how actively you use the headphones.) The headphone part is a little more traditional, despite being a new product category for Dyson. The company says its goal with the Zone was to create \u201cfaithful\u201d reproductions of a musician\u2019s original tracks. Noise cancellation is provided through a mix of passive cancellation from the overall design and active noise cancellation through a series of microphones. There are three different modes for noise cancellation on the Zone. Isolation mode has active ANC when the face visor is raised. Lowering the visor automatically shifts into conversation mode, which disables ANC so you can hear the person you\u2019re talking to. There\u2019s also a transparency mode, which filters out important sounds like car horns and sirens. Charging is done over USB-C, and the headphones connect to a Dyson Link app, which can provide more detailed information on the air quality around you. I was able to try a prototype of the Zone a few weeks ago, and it certainly seems to do what the company claims. I could feel the jets of air being pumped in front of my face \u2014 although I was indoors, so it was hard to tell just how much cleaner it was. ANC worked well, too (but, again, a quiet hotel room isn\u2019t the best test scenario), and the audio quality for music was good without particularly dramatic bass (which, arguably, was the company\u2019s goal). Despite Dyson\u2019s efforts, the Zone headphones are big and heavy On the flip side, the Zone headphones are also very big and noticeably heavy. Dyson has done an admirable job of cramming all this technology into a pair of headphones, but they\u2019re still comparatively bigger and bulkier than, say, a pair of Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones. Additionally, the whirring of the compressors was still slightly audible when the motors were running at faster speeds and I wasn\u2019t listening to music to drown it out, even despite the noise cancellation. The Zone is certainly one of the most unique products from Dyson (or likely any company) that we\u2019ll see this year. There are still a lot of crucial details we don\u2019t know \u2014 including price and battery life. And while mask-wearing has been normalized considerably over the past two years, we\u2019ll have to see whether customers will be willing to embrace this extremely odd-looking product.",

I could feel the jets of air being pumped in front of my face \u2014 although I was indoors, so it was hard to tell just how much cleaner it was. ANC worked well, too (but, again, a quiet hotel room isn\u2019t the best test scenario), and the audio quality for music was good without particularly dramatic bass (which, arguably, was the company\u2019s goal). On the flip side, the Zone headphones are also very big and noticeably heavy. Dyson has done an admirable job of cramming all this technology into a pair of headphones, but they\u2019re still comparatively bigger and bulkier than, say, a pair of Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones. Additionally, the whirring of the compressors was still slightly audible when the motors were running at faster speeds and I wasn\u2019t listening to music to drown it out, even despite the noise cancellation. The Zone is certainly one of the most unique products from Dyson (or likely any company) that we\u2019ll see this year. There are still a lot of crucial details we don\u2019t know \u2014 including price and battery life. And while mask-wearing has been normalized considerably over the past two years, we\u2019ll have to see whether customers will be willing to embrace this extremely odd-looking product.",

            "full_description": "Looking for a new pair of headphones? Worried about outdoor air pollution? You may be interested in Dyson's latest innovation: headphones that purify the air directly in front of your face. Announced on Wednesday, the Dyson Zone headphones have an attached face visor that dispenses purified air in front of your mouth and nose. Dyson says the Zone will be available this fall, but there's no word yet on pricing. Dyson has been selling indoor air purifiers since 2015, but this marks the company's first venture into both audio and wearable technology. And unlike other noise-cancelling headphones , these aim to tackle not just environmental noise, but also outdoor air pollution. Within each of the Zone's earcups is a tiny compressor motor and a dual-layer air filter. The first layer, a negatively charged electrostatic filter, promises to capture 99% of inhalable particles down to 0.1 microns in size, particularly brake dust emitted from cars, as well as pollen and bacteria. The second layer, made of potassium-enriched carbon, absorbs dangerous city gases, such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2). A duct on each earcup allows clean air to flow into the visor, which sits around the lower half of your face without touching it. The compressor in each earcup\u2014the smallest motor Dyson has ever manufactured\u2014serves as \"the heart of the machine,\" pulling outside air through the particle/carbon filter to the visor, creating a \"breathing zone of clean air\" for the wearer, Dyson's engineering manager Vicky Gibson-Robinson tells PCMag. In development for the past six years, the Zone headphones/air purifier were preceded by more than 500 prototypes, Dyson says. To test filtration efficacy, the company developed a mannequin head and torso outfitted with a mechanical lung and air quality sensors. Following the controversy over Razer's misleading Zephyr wearable air purifier marketing , Dyson was careful to caution that the Zone isn't a medical device, and isn't intended to prevent the spread of COVID-19. However, Gibson-Robinson says Dyson has tested the filter against viruses and bacteria the same size as COVID-19, and found it successfully captured them. Since the Zone's face visor doesn't actually touch your skin, you can still potentially breathe in some polluted cross wind while wearing it. In light of the pandemic, Dyson created a face covering you can optionally wear under the Zone's face visor, offering a sealed solution in places where masks are mandated, such as airplanes. The face covering attachment will come with the Zone. The visor offers three air purification levels: low, medium, and high, as well as an auto mode that automatically adjusts the fan speed based on movement data captured by a built-in accelerometer. If it senses you're walking, for instance, it will keep the fan speed on low. If you're climbing a flight of stairs, the fan speed will increase. Depending on use and where you live, the Zone's filter should last about a year before needing to be replaced. Its tiny filters fall short of the high-efficiency particulate absorbing (HEPA) standard, which requires the removal of at least 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns. Gibson-Robinson says a traditional HEPA filter small enough to fit in an earcup would impede airflow, so the company came up with a different solution. The resulting electrostatic filter pulls air in, and allows it to easily flow through, she says. \"Everything had to be miniaturized and optimized,\" according to Gibson-Robinson. The air purifier motor should be \"pretty quiet,\" even with the fan set to high and no music playing, she adds. \"When you put a motor that spins really fast next to an ear, you have to think about acoustics.\" Like Dyson's smart air purifiers, the Zone will send pollution data to a companion app, so you can monitor air quality and noise levels in real time. Let's not forget that this is also a pair of headphones, offering high-fidelity audio and three active noise cancellation (ANC) modes: Isolation, Conversation, and Transparency. Isolation mode offers the highest level of ANC for when you want to zone out (no pun intended). When you dip the face visor below your chin, the headphones automatically switch to Conversation mode, which turns off the air purifier. Transparency mode amplifies outside sounds such as emergency sirens and audio announcements so you can be more aware of your surroundings. The headphones have a microphone for phone calls, and you can remove the visor when you don't want or need to use air purification. Dyson expects to announce full product specs and additional details in the \"coming months.\" The company says that actual launch timing will vary by region. We'll be keeping track of the Zone, so make sure to check back for more details.",

The drop in pollution from tailpipes and power plants would prevent up to 110,000 premature deaths by 2050, the report projects. It would also avoid 2.78 million asthma attacks and 13.4 million lost workdays. All in all, that would amount to $1.2 trillion in public health benefits. That\u2019s assuming all new passenger cars sold in the US are EVs by 2035 and all new heavy-duty vehicles sold are electric by 2040. What\u2019s more, those vehicles would need to be powered by a fossil fuel-free grid. But replacing the vast majority of the nation\u2019s roughly 280 million cars and trucks on the road with electric vehicles in such a short timeframe remains virtually impossible. Just under 3 percent of new vehicles purchased in the US in 2021 are electric, despite their growing popularity. \u201cI can\u2019t ensure that they have clean, healthy air to breathe \u2014 and that is incredibly frustrating to me\u201d Regardless, the health advocates say a safe environment should be non-negotiable. \u201cI can advise [my patients] to limit their time spent outside to limit the pollution they are breathing; I can\u2019t ensure that they have clean, healthy air to breathe \u2014 and that is incredibly frustrating to me,\u201d Afif El-Hasan, a pediatrician and American Lung Association volunteer, said on a press call. \u201cIt should be a right of every child to play and develop somewhere safe. That should not be up for debate ever.\u201d More than four in 10 Americans live in a place with unhealthy levels of air pollution, according to the American Lung Association. Breathing in that pollution has been tied to cancer, heart attacks, strokes, and lung diseases. It can lead to impaired lung development in children, which can then affect them throughout their lives. Americans of color are also disproportionately burdened by air pollution, according to the American Lung Association; they\u2019re three times more likely to be breathing the worst air pollution compared to white Americans. For its new report, the American Lung Association looked at how phasing out fossil fuel combustion from the transportation and power sectors would limit key pollutants. That includes soot, smog-forming nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds, and sulfur dioxide coming from tailpipes and smokestacks. The report authors also studied another type of pollution that often flies under the radar and which electric vehicles are still responsible for: non-exhaust emissions. That includes particles that enter the air from the wear-and-tear of roads and vehicles, say from tires or brake pads. The persistence of this type of pollution shows why better public transportation and more walkable cities \u2014 to reduce reliance on driving \u2014 are also important for a healthier future. The report also points out health benefits from cutting down greenhouse gas emissions that drive climate change. A warming climate affects air quality by speeding up the chemical reaction that produces smog and exacerbating pollution from wildfires. E-bikes, scooters, and other light electric vehicles can also significantly cut down greenhouse gas pollution when they replace cars, according to a recent industry-commissioned report produced by the German Aerospace Center. In the US, President Joe Biden has set a goal of getting half of all new cars sold in the US by 2030 to be electric or hybrid vehicles. Earlier this month, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed new regulation specifically aimed at slashing pollution from trucks. The Biden administration\u2019s climate goals also include achieving a clean power sector by 2035. Phasing out fossil fuels from the power grid is essential for cleaning up transportation, the American Lung Association report highlights. And while many of these efforts remain aspirations for the future, pollution continues to take its toll on people\u2019s health now.",

On Tuesday, the federal government released its plan for how it hopes to achieve its latest goal, which is to cut carbon-related pollution by 40 to 45 per cent from 2005 levels by the end of the decade. Tory environment critic Kyle Seeback says the party doesn\u2019t support that plan. Instead, it favours the target the Conservative government set back in 2015 under the leadership of former prime minister Stephen Harper. When he came into office later that year, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signed onto the plan, committing under the Paris agreement to reduce the country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. Last year Trudeau increased those targets ahead of international climate talks in the fall, saying Canada now aims for 40 to 45 per cent below 2005 levels. \u201cIt\u2019s great to intend things and to hope for things,\u201d Seeback said on Tuesday. \u201cWhat we need (are) actual plans that result in emission reductions and what we get from this government are plans that cost a lot of money.\u201d He pointed out that the Liberals have failed to achieve past climate goals and dismissed the plan presented Tuesday as lacking in details about the impact the reductions would have on resource-based industries and taxpayers. \u201cI\u2019m all for aspirational things, but at the end of the day, what we need are plans that actually work and don\u2019t have incredibly catastrophic effects on the Canadian economy.\u201d Conservative leadership contenders will need to address their ideas for the country\u2019s approach to climate change as they compete for the party\u2019s top job. The new leader is set to be announced Sept. 10. Much of the party\u2019s support comes from Western Canada, home to oil-producing provinces that want to ensure the sector\u2019s survival. At the same time, the Tories have also had to deal with criticism that they didn\u2019t present a plan to properly tackle climate change during the 2019 federal election campaign. Candidates have kicked off the first weeks of the current race by championing a rallying cry from 2019 that remains popular with the grassroots: a promise to scrap the carbon price. That\u2019s something many members are excited to hear after former leader Erin O\u2019Toole promised a carbon price of his own in an effort to course-correct during the most recent election. Ottawa-area MP Pierre Poilievre has been beating that drum and plans to hold a rally in the nation\u2019s capital Friday against the scheduled rise in the federal charge, which is set to take effect that day. Poilievre didn\u2019t directly answer when asked whether he supports the current government\u2019s 2030 targets, but in a statement Tuesday said Trudeau would \u201cdrive up energy prices at home and oil production abroad.\u201d He is campaigning on a promise to build more pipelines and end Canada\u2019s foreign oil imports. When it comes to combating climate change, he vows to reduce emissions through \u201ctechnology and not taxes.\u201d \u201cThese technologies include carbon capture, emissions-free nuclear power and helping other countries shut down their coal-fired power plants by exporting them cleaner natural gas, nuclear power and hydroelectricity,\u201d Poilievre said in a statement. In another statement, Michelle Coates Mather, a spokeswoman for Jean Charest \u2014 the former Quebec premier who introduced a cap-and-trade system for that province \u2014 said he would release his plan for the environment in the \u201cweeks ahead.\u201d \u201cMr. Charest agrees with lowering emissions,\u201d she wrote, adding he\u2019s the only candidate \u201cwho has a track record on emissions and cutting pollution.\u201d Since he entered the race, Charest has expressed support for carbon pricing, but has so far declined to say when he endorses one for consumer goods, like fuel. On Tuesday, Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown also sidestepped a question about his support for Canada\u2019s 2030 targets. He tweeted that Ottawa should forgo its planned increase to the federal carbon price and pledged to make sure the Conservative party has a climate plan that protects the energy sector and taxpayers. Scott Aitchison, a rural Ontario MP who\u2019s running for leader, said in a statement that he supports \u201cCanada\u2019s original Paris commitments\u201d and believes in the need to shore up the country\u2019s infrastructure against the effects of climate change to mitigate costs.

On Tuesday, the federal government released its plan for how it hopes to achieve its latest goal, which is to cut carbon-related pollution by 40 to 45 per cent from 2005 levels by the end of the decade.

But they didn\u2019t seem to like the answers they got.Executives from Texas-based Vistra Corp met with community leaders at the Washington Township municipal building to answer questions about Zimmer\u2019s closure on May 31.The plant has provided millions in tax revenue and steady, well-paying jobs in Clermont County for decades.\u201cIt\u2019s just hard to believe the plant won\u2019t be there, all that it\u2019s done for the community, those jobs, and it\u2019s gone,\u201d said Brad Watson, Vistra\u2019s senior director of community affairs. \u201cThe plants when they close, they\u2019ve been operating for decades, it\u2019s like the passing of an old friend.\u201dVistra plans to repurpose a portion of the Zimmer site for battery storage, Watson said, which will create hundreds of temporary construction jobs and tens of millions in investment.But Watson acknowledged the project will fall well short of the 150 jobs that Zimmer provided and the millions in tax revenue that built new fire stations and schools, paved roads and replaced household septic tanks with municipally treated water.Zimmer will be the sixth coal-burning power plant in the region to close since 2013, a trend that\u2019s driven by the increasing cost of complying with air-pollution rules and cheaper energy sources like natural gas.Some of Zimmer\u2019s employees will transfer to another Vistra-owned plant \u2013 the Miami Fort Generating Station in Hamilton County. But Miami Fort is also scheduled to close by 2027, and it may close sooner.\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why you have two plants in Adams County, then Beckjord, just along the Ohio River, closing. No one is going to buy them. They\u2019re too costly to run,\u201d Watson said.Duke Energy closed the former Walter C. Beckjord coal plant near New Richmond in 2014 and sold the 1400-acre site to Commercial Liability Partners four years later. CLP is now demolishing the plant.The New Richmond School District took a big hit on lost tax revenue when Beckjord closed, and is about to take another one with Zimmer\u2019s closure.\u201cIf New Richmond schools is going to have to pay you back $2.5 million dollars, it\u2019s going to devastate that school district,\u201d said Dennis Cooper, chairman of the board of trustees in Washington Township, which gets 30 percent of its revenue from Zimmer.Not only will Clermont communities, schools, and libraries lose future tax revenue when Zimmer closes, they may be forced to repay back taxes.That\u2019s because Vistra is challenging the county auditor\u2019s $140 million property valuation of the plant and surrounding land, arguing that it is worth 80 percent less \u2013 or $28.5 million. A hearing is set before the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals in Columbus on July 26.If Vistra wins its appeal, some public entities will be forced to repay the more than $4 million in tax revenue they received over the past two years. The village of Moscow, Monroe and Washington townships, New Richmond schools, county libraries, Grant Career Center, and Clermont County could be substantially impacted.\u201cIf I add all these together you\u2019re going to have a payback of $4 million,\u201d Cooper said, during a series of heated exchanges with Watson at the meeting.\u201cOur goal is fair value of the plant. As applied by law. And that\u2019s fair for every taxpayer,\u201d Watson said.Watson couldn\u2019t say how much communities will lose in tax revenue. Vistra is still negotiating with New Richmond Schools over a multiyear tax agreement.\u201cWe will always pay our fair share of taxes and in this case we are willing to pay more than our fair share,\u201d Watson said. \u201cBut it has to be realistic to what the market value of that plant is worth.\u201dThe Washington Township trustees had plenty of other questions, such as what would happen to the other land locally that Vistra owns, and if building a solar power facility is a possibility.While Watson did not have specific answers, he said Vistra has, \u201cnot ruled out solar,\u201d but that battery storage on Zimmer was \u201ca higher probability.\u201dVistra does not currently have plans for its other local properties but will not sell them right away, Watson said.

            "content": "OTTAWA \u2014 Canada has had at least 11 different climate plans and nine emissions targets since 1988. Here\u2019s a snapshot of some of them. 1988: Canada hosts a conference in Toronto called Changing Atmosphere: Implications for Global Security, where governments and NGOs agree that human behaviour is affecting the atmosphere. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney gives the opening address, and by the end of the event, parties agree to strive to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 20 per cent below 1988 levels by 2005. 1990: The Mulroney government releases the Green Plan, which includes $175 million for about two dozen new policies on greenhouse gas emissions, including investments in energy efficiency, alternative energy and tree planting. It sets a goal to \u201cstabilize\u201d emissions at 1990 levels by 2000. 1992: Canada signs the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Rio de Janeiro, which sets up the next three decades of global conferences to address greenhouse gas emissions. 1993: In the federal election, Liberal Leader Jean Chr\u00e9tien promises to cut emissions to 80 per cent of what they were in 1988 by 2005, the same target Mulroney agreed to in 1988. 1995: Chretien\u2019s government introduces the National Action Program on Climate Change, promising to cut 66 million tonnes of emissions from current levels in 15 years. The plan includes more than 400 possible projects or programs, such as retrofitting federal buildings, updating the national building code to identify thermal efficiencies and convincing industry to voluntarily submit climate plans. 1997: Canada agrees to the Kyoto Protocol, an extension of the UN climate framework. It sets a new target to cut emissions to six per cent below 1990 levels by 2012. 1998: The federal government introduces its new Action Plan 2000 on Climate Change to work toward its Kyoto target, with a $500-million investment over five years. It includes goals to improve vehicle fuel efficiency, investments in renewable energy and a promise to look further at using carbon capture and storage technology in the oil and gas sector. 2002: Climate Change Plan for Canada, another pathway toward the Kyoto target, talks about emissions credits trading, increased use of ethanol and biodiesel, investments in public transit and aiming to retrofit one-fifth of commercial and institutional buildings by 2010. 2005: Project Green: A Plan for Honouring our Kyoto Commitment followed the 2005 federal budget, which included more than $3 billion in climate investments, including funds to encourage wind power and other renewable energy options and tax incentives for efficient energy generation. The latest plan encourages the development of a domestic emissions credit trading system, and promises to regulate emissions from certain industries. 2007: Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper, a year after saying Canada wouldn\u2019t be able to meet the Kyoto target, sets a new goal to cut emissions to 20 per cent below 2006 levels by 2020. It\u2019s the first to base its action mostly on cutting emissions intensity \u2014 the amount of greenhouse gas produced per unit of production, such as per barrel of oil, or tonne of steel. 2009: Canada signs the Copenhagen Accord, a new global climate plan under which Canada promises to cut emissions 17 per cent below 2005 levels by 2020. 2011: Canada formally withdraws from the Kyoto Protocol. 2015: Environment Minister Leona Aglukkaq submits a new national emissions target ahead of a major UN climate conference in Paris. The new target, 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, comes with promises to cut methane emissions in the oil and gas sector, and regulations for natural gas power plants and fertilizer production. In November, just weeks after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the Liberals win the election and take office, Canada signs the Paris agreement at that UN conference, using the same Conservative targets. 2016: Trudeau surprises and angers some premiers with a sudden plan to impose a minimum price on pollution on provinces without their own similar plan. Shortly after, most provinces sign on the Pan-Canadian Framework for Clean Growth and Climate Change, which shows a path of policies to get Canada much of the way to the Paris target. They include the carbon price, as well as better building codes, eliminating coal power and a clean fuel standard to reduce emissions generated by burning fuels. 2020: Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson introduces a \u201cstrengthened\u201d climate plan aiming to introduce more measures to try and meet the original 2030 target and start working toward net-zero emissions by 2050. A Healthy Environment and a Healthy Economy promises to keep increasing the carbon price until it reaches $170 a tonne in 2030, and to invest in clean technology and a national clean electricity grid. 2021: Canada submits updated emissions targets to the UN, now aiming for 40 to 45 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. It also passes the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act, which enshrines the targets into law for the first time, and requires regular reporting and reviews of progress. 2022: Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault introduces the Emissions Reduction Plan, showing the path to getting to the new 2030 targets.

The latest plan encourages the development of a domestic emissions credit trading system, and promises to regulate emissions from certain industries. 2007: Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper, a year after saying Canada wouldn\u2019t be able to meet the Kyoto target, sets a new goal to cut emissions to 20 per cent below 2006 levels by 2020. It\u2019s the first to base its action mostly on cutting emissions intensity \u2014 the amount of greenhouse gas produced per unit of production, such as per barrel of oil, or tonne of steel. 2009: Canada signs the Copenhagen Accord, a new global climate plan under which Canada promises to cut emissions 17 per cent below 2005 levels by 2020. 2011: Canada formally withdraws from the Kyoto Protocol. 2015: Environment Minister Leona Aglukkaq submits a new national emissions target ahead of a major UN climate conference in Paris. The new target, 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, comes with promises to cut methane emissions in the oil and gas sector, and regulations for natural gas power plants and fertilizer production. In November, just weeks after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the Liberals win the election and take office, Canada signs the Paris agreement at that UN conference, using the same Conservative targets. 2016: Trudeau surprises and angers some premiers with a sudden plan to impose a minimum price on pollution on provinces without their own similar plan. Shortly after, most provinces sign on the Pan-Canadian Framework for Clean Growth and Climate Change, which shows a path of policies to get Canada much of the way to the Paris target. They include the carbon price, as well as better building codes, eliminating coal power and a clean fuel standard to reduce emissions generated by burning fuels. 2020: Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson introduces a \u201cstrengthened\u201d climate plan aiming to introduce more measures to try and meet the original 2030 target and start working toward net-zero emissions by 2050. A Healthy Environment and a Healthy Economy promises to keep increasing the carbon price until it reaches $170 a tonne in 2030, and to invest in clean technology and a national clean electricity grid. 2021: Canada submits updated emissions targets to the UN, now aiming for 40 to 45 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. It also passes the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act, which enshrines the targets into law for the first time, and requires regular reporting and reviews of progress. 2022: Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault introduces the Emissions Reduction Plan, showing the path to getting to the new 2030 targets.

Prime Minister Brian Mulroney gives the opening address, and by the end of the event, parties agree to strive to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 20 per cent below 1988 levels by 2005. 1990: The Mulroney government releases the Green Plan, which includes $175 million for about two dozen new policies on greenhouse gas emissions, including investments in energy efficiency, alternative energy and tree planting. It sets a goal to \u201cstabilize\u201d emissions at 1990 levels by 2000. 1992: Canada signs the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Rio de Janeiro, which sets up the next three decades of global conferences to address greenhouse gas emissions. 1993: In the federal election, Liberal Leader Jean Chr\u00e9tien promises to cut emissions to 80 per cent of what they were in 1988 by 2005, the same target Mulroney agreed to in 1988. 1995: Chretien\u2019s government introduces the National Action Program on Climate Change, promising to cut 66 million tonnes of emissions from current levels in 15 years. The plan includes more than 400 possible projects or programs, such as retrofitting federal buildings, updating the national building code to identify thermal efficiencies and convincing industry to voluntarily submit climate plans. 1997: Canada agrees to the Kyoto Protocol, an extension of the UN climate framework.

Building a sustainable future is only possible if we proactively address every aspect of this problem. In this regard, soil pollution due to the accumulation of heavy metals (HMs) poses a serious threat to sustainable development as well as human health. This is because the HMs that enter the soil eventually find their way up the food chain, and upon entering the human body, can cause life-threatening diseases like cancer, renal failure, and cardiovascular disease. Minimizing HM concentration in soils is, therefore, a key goal in our fight against environmental pollution.",

But rather than simply complain, she and a group of other young people are taking on who they see as the enablers of this pollution: government officials who continue to green-light fossil fuel development. Earlier this month, seven young activists filed a lawsuit against the state of Utah with the help of Our Children\u2019s Trust, a nonprofit law firm that focuses on climate justice. Natalie R. v. State of Utah alleges that the state and its elected officials unconstitutionally favour fossil fuel companies at the expense of residents\u2019 rights to a healthy and safe life.

They need relief today,\u201d Welle said. I spoke with Natalie, a high school student in Salt Lake City, about the lawsuit and what drove her to activism. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity. Angely Mercado, Earther: How did you become involved in filing this lawsuit? Natalie: I\u2019m an activist with an organisation here in Utah called Fridays for Future Utah, and so I had been planning a couple of climate strikes. I hadn\u2019t heard of Our Children\u2019s Trust up until Earth Day last year, when I was presenting with Sierra Club. I wondered if there was a Utah movement, because I heard of lawsuits occurring in [other] states. Then we started an interview process to figure out how we would pursue this lawsuit, and since then six other people have joined. Since my complaint is the first listed, it just happens to be my name, but we\u2019re all equally part of it. Earther: Why take legal action, as opposed to organising another climate strike or finding other ways to push Utah\u2019s elected officials? window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_1_hpu-mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); Natalie: It\u2019s different from just doing a regular strike, because we can take legal action in this case. And if the court decides that our constitutional rights are being violated, then we can get legal change. We live in a society where most change is made through the government. I would encourage people to look at how their legal rights and liberties are violated through their government\u2019s actions and how they\u2019re being impacted by climate change. When people can see what their governments are doing that is violating their rights as citizens \u2014 that\u2019s pretty powerful to help them take action. Earther: You feel that the state has not protected your constitutional rights. Can you explain that more? Natalie: Utah has many laws in place that support the fossil fuel industry and allow for permitting for exploration, extraction, and exportation of fossil fuels and also for them to be combusted in the state, which is causing significant problems with our air quality. Personally, I\u2019m a very active person and I like to go outside, so [it\u2019s about our rights] to be able to be outside and lead a physically active lifestyle and a healthy lifestyle, as well as mental health when being outdoors. Sometimes I\u2019m not able to go outside, because the air quality is deemed toxic and harmful. That\u2019s a violation of my rights, because I should be able to go outside. This happens quite a bit, especially over the past two years. We\u2019ve had very bad air quality going into Salt Lake. And then we\u2019ve also experienced heat warnings. Earther: How does it feel to sue your state government? window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_2_mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); Natalie: It does feel a little weird, but with the support of everybody, with all the plaintiffs and with [attorneys] Andrew and Amira, it doesn\u2019t feel like that daunting of a task. There\u2019s a bunch of youth, ages nine to 18, suing their government, and that\u2019s not something you hear about every day. Earther: How have people you know reacted to the news? Natalie: There\u2019s not too many reactions at the moment, but I think if we get a court day, and once we get more publicity on this, hopefully, there\u2019ll be more support from students my age\u2026 that\u2019s what I\u2019ve hoped for. Earther: What do you most want the public to understand about this lawsuit? Natalie: It\u2019s not that the state isn\u2019t doing enough to combat climate change. It\u2019s that they\u2019re actively contributing to it through the laws that they\u2019ve enacted. And so while they are, in a sense, not doing enough, they are also actively contributing. A win in this case would reduce emissions, help improve the air quality, and in general provide a better climate.

(Shutterstock)Plastic pollution is a global problem, contaminating terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems. Microplastics \u2014 plastic particles smaller than five millimetres in size \u2014 infiltrate and circulate in the global planetary dust cycle, water cycle and carbon cycle. Microplastics have infiltrated the food and water we consume and the air we breathe. These tiny plastic particles can harm wildlife populations and communities, threatening the ecological balance. A new paper suggests plastics are a planetary boundary threat and that we are outside the safe operating space. In early March, after years of negotiations, delegates from 175 nations committed to draft the first global treaty on plastic pollution at the UN Environment Assembly in Nairobi. This resolution comes 30 years after the creation of the first global treaty to address climate change in 1992, which recognized there was a problem with greenhouse gases but did not include quantitative global targets until the Kyoto Protocol in 2005. As researchers studying plastic pollution and working at the science-policy interface, we believe there is enough evidence regarding contamination and the effects of plastic pollution to see that the first treaty on plastic needs to include quantitative targets and binding measures that facilitate a circular economy \u2014 a system that focuses on reusing and reducing plastic waste. No time to waste As with climate change, the urgency to find a solution to plastic pollution is clear. Trends show an increasing trajectory for plastic emissions \u2014 plastic emitted into the environment \u2014 just as they do for greenhouse gas emissions. In 2021, we estimated that around 30 million tonnes of plastic waste was emitted into freshwater and marine ecosystems. If we continue business as usual, that number could increase more than two-fold by the end of this decade. In 2017, we called for a global treaty to facilitate collaboration on this global issue, and in 2020 a systemic shift in the plastics economy \u2014 bending our current linear plastic economy (make-take-waste) into a circular economy (make-take-reuse), fundamentally changing the way we use plastic materials to minimize waste. A giant art sculpture showing a tap outpouring plastic bottles was erected outside the UN Environment Program headquarters in Nairobi, on March 2, 2022, during the UN Environment Assembly where delegates met to discuss a binding international framework to address the growing problem of plastic waste in the world\u2019s oceans, rivers and landscapes. (AP Photo/Brian Inganga) Our vision of an effective treaty A global treaty on plastic must have a circular economy at its core. It should also set global targets for reducing plastic emissions akin to the Paris Agreement for carbon emissions. To facilitate success, the treaty should include global mechanisms that incentivize a circular economy, methods for reporting plastic emissions at the local and national level and resources that aid economies in measuring and reducing these emissions. To measurably reduce plastic emissions, we envision a global treaty where countries sign on as signatories with a defined reduction target. For example, each country might agree to reduce 40 per cent of its emissions by 2030 from base-year levels. To facilitate a circular economy, there needs to be a global cap on virgin plastic production, recycled content standards or a shift from incentives for virgin plastic to incentives for post-consumer recycled plastic. When it comes to dealing with plastic waste, we need to switch our make-take-waste approach for a make-take-reuse one. Each country needs to come up with a strategy to meet reduction targets. Because there is no one-size-fits-all solution, each country may take on its own set of unique solutions to reach its target. For example, countries may adopt container deposit schemes to increase recycling rates, eliminate the use of single-use plastic items like plastic bags and straws that are not essential and do not fit into a circular economy, improve waste collection and management infrastructure, and agree to market only plastics that are either recyclable or reusable in their region, if not both. Each year countries must report their plastic emissions to a body like the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as part of this treaty. Determining baseline emissions, setting reduction targets and tracking our progress towards meeting those targets require formal accounting. Regular reporting of plastic emissions to the UNFCCC as part of this new treaty could help countries set reduction targets and track their progress towards meeting those targets. (Shutterstock) Here, another tool we can borrow from climate policy is the emissions inventory, which accounts for the total amount of emissions that originates from relevant sources within cities, provinces, states or countries. Emissions inventories help prioritize the reduction of emissions from the largest sources within a given region and are necessary to accurately check the effectiveness of solutions. Emissions inventories will quantify progress, identify leaders and laggards and document the success of our transition to a circular economy. For some countries, aid will be necessary to build new infrastructure for reducing plastic pollution. These countries need access to a global fund, similar to the UNFCCC\u2019s climate fund. To build this fund, an extended producer responsibility program \u2014 a materials management program funded by those who make plastics \u2014 can be implemented. For example, if a fund pulled in $0.01 for every pound of virgin plastic produced, it would have equated to $8 billion per year in 2020. Let\u2019s get to work For plastic pollution, the phrase \u201cthere is no time to waste\u201d is not just clever, it is spot on. As we negotiate how we will end plastic pollution, the problem continues to grow. We cannot wait another decade to establish baselines, reduction targets and thresholds for the safety of our environment and human health. We are optimistic about the recent resolution to draft a global treaty on plastic pollution and thrilled that Canada aims to be a leader in its creation and actions necessary to make positive change. International governments have provided an opportunity for systemic change, so let us make the most of it and develop a global treaty with quantitative targets and binding resolutions that measurably reduce our production of plastic waste and pollution.

The goal of the campaign, dubbed \u201cChange the code, not the climate,\u201d is to switch up the energy-hungry process of verifying transactions and mining new Bitcoins. The cryptocurrency uses more electricity annually than global gold mining operations or the entire country of Norway, according to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. Burning through so much energy generates some serious greenhouse gas emissions, but campaign organizers argue that it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. Other cryptocurrencies use just a fraction of the energy Bitcoin requires because they use a different system to verify transactions. \u201cChange the code, not the climate\u201d In order to validate transactions, Bitcoin miners rely on specialized hardware to solve complex puzzles. Their computers gobble up a lot of energy in the process, and the miners get new tokens in return. It\u2019s a process called \u201cproof of work,\u201d in which the energy used is sort of the price paid to verify transactions. The process is deliberately energy-intensive as a safety measure. The baked-in inefficiency is meant to discourage bad actors from manipulating the data because it would cost a lot of energy to do so. The new campaign aims to move Bitcoin away from that energy-hungry proof of work process. The most popular alternative is called proof of stake. Cryptocurrencies that use proof of stake use vastly less energy because there are no puzzles to solve. Instead of essentially paying with electricity to participate in the process, you have to offer up some of your own tokens. This is supposed to prove that you have a \u201cstake\u201d in keeping the ledger accurate. If you mess anything up, you lose tokens as a penalty.

            "full_description": "Greenpeace and other environmental groups launched a new campaign today to push the Bitcoin network to slash its growing greenhouse gas emissions. The goal of the campaign, dubbed \u201cChange the code, not the climate,\u201d is to switch up the energy-hungry process of verifying transactions and mining new Bitcoins. The cryptocurrency uses more electricity annually than global gold mining operations or the entire country of Norway, according to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance . Burning through so much energy generates some serious greenhouse gas emissions, but campaign organizers argue that it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. Other cryptocurrencies use just a fraction of the energy Bitcoin requires because they use a different system to verify transactions. In order to validate transactions, Bitcoin miners rely on specialized hardware to solve complex puzzles. Their computers gobble up a lot of energy in the process, and the miners get new tokens in return. It\u2019s a process called \u201cproof of work,\u201d in which the energy used is sort of the price paid to verify transactions. The process is deliberately energy-intensive as a safety measure. The baked-in inefficiency is meant to discourage bad actors from manipulating the data because it would cost a lot of energy to do so. The new campaign aims to move Bitcoin away from that energy-hungry proof of work process. The most popular alternative is called proof of stake. Cryptocurrencies that use proof of stake use vastly less energy because there are no puzzles to solve. Instead of essentially paying with electricity to participate in the process, you have to offer up some of your own tokens. This is supposed to prove that you have a \u201cstake\u201d in keeping the ledger accurate. If you mess anything up, you lose tokens as a penalty. While proof of stake might make solve a lot of Bitcoin\u2019s pollution problems, experts have been skeptical that miners would be willing to make the change.

            "full_description": "OTTAWA\u2014The federal government has unveiled its new road map to slash greenhouse gas emissions over the next decade, charting more than $9 billion in new spending on climate initiatives and a vision to reverse and drive down rising carbon pollution from Canada\u2019s oil and gas sector. Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault tabled the plan Tuesday morning in the House of Commons. The plan is a key requirement of the government\u2019s climate \u201caccountability\u201d law that is meant to ensure Canada breaks its losing streak and finally fulfils a promise to reduce greenhouse gas pollution that causes climate change. One significant part of that will be to reduce emissions from Canada\u2019s oil and gas sector, where emissions from extraction increased about 67 per cent between 2005 and 2019, according to the most recent federal data. The Liberals have promised to implement an emissions cap on the sector, and the new plan outlines how the government expects emissions from the oil and gas industry \u2014 responsible for more than a quarter of Canada\u2019s national emissions in 2019 \u2014 to drop 42 per cent below current levels by 2030. The plan also charts expected emissions reductions from buildings, transportation, heavy industry and electricity. To help drive these reductions, the plan includes extra money for federal climate programs, including $2.2 billion for the \u201cLow Carbon Economy Fund,\u201d which finances clean energy projects, $850 millions for clean electricity projects as Canada, and $780 million for projects that conserve wetlands and other natural features that store carbon. On zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs), the plan pledges another $400 million to build more charging stations, and $1.7 billion to extend the incentive program for people who buy these cars. The Canada Infrastructure Bank is also committing to spend $500 million on ZEV infrastructure, the plan says. The government will also require that at least 20 per cent of new light-duty vehicles sold in 2026 are ZEVs, a threshold that will increase to 60 per cent in 2030 and 100 per cent in 2035. Last year, the Liberal government ditched the climate target it inherited from Stephen Harper\u2019s Conservative administration \u2014 and committed to under the international Paris Agreement in 2015 \u2014 and replaced it with a more ambitious goal of slashing emissions to at least 40 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. But Canada is a long way from that target. The latest emissions data compiled by Environment Canada shows that greenhouse gas pollution only dropped by about one per cent from 2005 to 2019. Significant declines in emissions from electricity generation, thanks in large part to the government-enforced closure of coal-fired power plants, were offset over that time by marked increases in emissions from oil and gas extraction (67 per cent) and road transportation (14 per cent), the data shows. Tuesday\u2019s new plan is meant to finally drive down annual emissions toward the 2030 goal \u2014 and break Canada\u2019s sorry losing streak on its international climate commitments. This country has failed on every promise to slash emissions it has ever made, a dismal record that the federal environment commissioner bemoaned last year as he noted Canada\u2019s roughly one-per-cent increase in emissions since the Liberals took power in 2015 is the worst performance in the G7. The plan includes an \u201cinterim objective\u201d to slash emissions by at least 20 per cent below 2005 levels by 2026, and says that measures included in the plan are projected to cut emissions by 36 per cent in 2030, with measures still under development to be designed to help close the remaining gap to at least 40 per cent that year.

The government\u2019s detailed, sector-by-sector roadmap for curbing emissions in the country by 40 \u2013 45 per cent of 2005 levels by the end of the decade \u2014 is now a legal requirement under a new net-zero accountability law the Liberals passed last year. The 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan \u2013 Canada\u2019s Next Steps for Clean Air and a Strong Economy is projecting that electricity emissions will be almost zero by the end of the decade but it will take longer to see real progress from the transportation sector. It announces more than 9.1 billion in new investments, which includes more than a billion dollars in efforts to move towards electric vehicles, as well as millions in support for farmers and communities to adopt cleaner practices in the journey to zero emissions. In the past, Canada has outlined 11 plans and nine different emissions targets since 1988 \u2014 none of them ever met. \u201cThe reason Canada has historically missed every single one of the emissions targets it has set for itself is not because our targets were too ambitious,\u201d Climate Action Network Canada policy manager Caroline Brouillette said. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s quite the contrary. The reason we haven\u2019t reached these targets is because of a critical lack of climate governance in Canada,\u201d she said. That is supposed to change, however, under the new accountability legislation.

That includes timelines and clearly defining which minister is responsible for each specific emissions reduction measure. But, she says there is an \u201celephant in the room\u201d in terms of Canada\u2019s climate policy. \u201cThat is the continued expansion of the oil and gas sector. Even though we have reduced the emissions produced by every barrel of oil produced in Canada, we have expanded production. That means, over time, our emissions from that sector have increased, and today they are the largest share of our economy\u2019s emissions at 26 per cent.\u201d Brouillette believes the oil and gas industry needs to do its \u201cfair share\u201d to mitigate its greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cIf one sector doesn\u2019t do its part, the burden will fall on other sectors of the economy, other workers and other consumers.\u201d Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will be joined by Environment and Climate Minister Steven Guilbeault and Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson in Vancouver Tuesday to talk about the new plan.

            "full_description": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Natural gas utilities are increasingly promoting hydrogen\u2014which emits no greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions when burned\u2014as a promising path to preserve their business model while meeting demands to cut emissions. This trend is accelerating, with at least 26 projects proposed across more than a dozen states since 2020. The utility vision seems clear: Blend hydrogen with natural gas using existing pipeline networks, eventually switching entirely to hydrogen or blending it with other low- or zero-carbon fuels. But it\u2019s not that simple. New Energy Innovation research finds using hydrogen in homes and buildings is fraught with economic, logistical, and safety challenges, capable of reducing GHG emissions less than 7% before encountering potentially insurmountable roadblocks. Natural gas meters are fixed to the outside of residential townhouses and apartments at a building ... [+] complex in Exton, Pennsylvania, October 6, 2017. With locally produced natural gas, Pennsylvania has become a major exporter of natural gas and a force behind the rise of gas in the U.S. power sector. (Photo by Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images) Getty Images ADVERTISEMENT Gas utilities may view hydrogen as an attractive path to continue business-as-usual and a lifeline to maintain their market share. While utilities generally pass fuel costs on to their customers, they profit by investing in infrastructure \u2014needed to entice private investors to lend utilities their capital. A decarbonization strategy centered around maintaining, retrofitting, and building new pipelines to increase hydrogen use thus makes these companies more valuable. However, these hydrogen-centric plans are a bad bet for consumers and the climate. Regulators approving new utility hydrogen projects could forestall the electrification of buildings\u2014a far more cost-effective and safer pathway to reducing GHG emissions that necessarily sees gas utilities\u2019 role, and profits, shrink over time. State utility regulators should thus be highly skeptical of ratepayer-funded gas utility proposals to advance hydrogen as a primary strategy to cut emissions from buildings. Separately, policymakers should consider carefully how hydrogen fits in with carbon reduction goals to avoid supporting dead-end pathways, instead advancing more viable options such as a managed transition to all-electric buildings. ADVERTISEMENT Hydrogen may be a myopic path with little to gain Gas utilities and their regulators should seek cost-effective GHG emissions reductions using measures that enhance\u2014or at least don\u2019t compromise\u2014public health and safety, reliability, and service quality. Even where states have less-ambitious climate targets than a zero-emissions gas system, regulators should consider pathways that wouldn\u2019t require utilities to dramatically change course if the latter becomes law. Utilities can produce zero-carbon \u201cgreen\u201d hydrogen from renewable electricity and water, a process called electrolysis which emits oxygen as its only byproduct. By blending green hydrogen with natural gas, utilities can reduce the carbon intensity of their delivered fuel. However, research suggests utilities can only safely blend up to 20% hydrogen with natural gas using today\u2019s pipelines and appliances, even after extensive testing and targeted pipeline retrofits. Because burning hydrogen releases less energy than methane\u2014the primary component in natural gas\u2014a 20% blend only reduces GHG emissions 6%-7%, and green hydrogen\u2019s higher production costs today would raise the price of this blended fuel two to four times above standard natural gas. ADVERTISEMENT Utilities aware of hydrogen blending\u2019s bad value proposition are favoring a more expansive strategy. Some are exploring \u201cblue\u201d hydrogen, which strips hydrogen from methane and attempts to capture most of the carbon dioxide emissions for storage underground. Many are also pursuing chemically identical sources of methane, whether synthetically produced or derived from sources like landfills and pig farms. However, blue hydrogen faces the same blending limits as green hydrogen without the same depth of emissions reductions . Other \u201cclean fuels\u201d can directly substitute for natural gas but suffer from methane leaks throughout the pipeline network. They are also either expensive or can\u2019t scale\u2014for example, waste-derived biogas in the United States can only supply 1.5% of national consumption. Fuel inputs of hydrogen production. S&P Global Market Intelligence ADVERTISEMENT When climate policy requires utilities to make deeper emissions reductions for a net-zero economy, hydrogen blends and \u201cclean fuels\u201d will eventually reach their limits. But in that time, utilities could spend many years investing in a system only capable of handling 20% hydrogen at great consumer expense and with little upside. Continuing down this path toward a 100% green hydrogen-capable distribution system, replete with compliant consumer appliances, promises high utility profits but sidelines the more effective electrification strategy. The expensive, logistical nightmare of a hydrogen transition Hydrogen is a smaller and much more flammable molecule than methane, and itself is a climate-warming compound (though less so than methane). This means it can leak more easily through pipes and embrittle them, accumulating either in the atmosphere or in enclosures\u2014including homes\u2014which can cause explosions. This means any gas utility aiming for 100% hydrogen would need to upgrade its distribution system depending on each pipe\u2019s age, size, material, and operating pressure. Household appliances pose an even bigger hurdle, because they\u2019re optimized for natural gas and are generally incapable of safely handling more than a 5%-20% hydrogen blend. Manufacturers would need to develop furnaces, water heaters, stoves, dryers, and industrial equipment capable of handling pure hydrogen, pure natural gas, and any blend in between. Utilities would then need to coordinate replacing every single appliance in their service area before increasing their blend beyond 5%-20% as any missed appliances would cause an explosion. ADVERTISEMENT A photo illustration shows gas burning stove. (Photo by Paul ELLIS / AFP) (Photo by PAUL ELLIS/AFP ... [+] via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images If manufacturers can\u2019t find a way to design these hybrid appliances and can only build appliances capable of burning 100% hydrogen, this switchover would be impossible without long and severe gaps in gas service. Utilities would have to keep hydrogen blending levels low so long as any old appliances remained on its system; however, consumers wouldn\u2019t be able to operate any new hydrogen-only appliances until utilities switched to a 100% hydrogen fuel system. By contrast, a quarter of U.S. homes are already all-electric, and about half of single-family homes are already wired for all-electric appliances. Switching from gas to electric equipment can happen incrementally with existing infrastructure, and electrified buildings connect directly to an increasingly clean electricity grid, thus supporting decarbonization. Some homes would need new electrical panels or wiring, and utilities might need to upgrade distribution system equipment, but these investments also support the ongoing transition to electric vehicles while boosting grid reliability. ADVERTISEMENT Now we\u2019re cooking with electricity Energy-efficient electric appliances would bring lower energy bills compared to hydrogen-burning counterparts\u2014and already do on average relative to today\u2019s natural gas-burning appliances. These lower costs result from two inherent advantages: using more efficient processes than combustion, and avoiding the energy lost from electrolysis to produce green hydrogen. Today\u2019s electric heat pumps, which heat and cool air, would use electricity three to six times more efficiently than hydrogen-compatible heating equipment. This has serious implications for how much renewable generation the U.S. will need to build to support the decarbonization of our buildings. For example, one estimate shows heating a home with green hydrogen would require five times more renewable electricity than doing so with an efficient electric heat pump. Even in cold climates when heat pumps perform at their lowest efficiency, they still operate more efficiently than gas alternatives. These thermodynamics won\u2019t change, with 15 independent studies finding hydrogen is too costly and inefficient to consider as a means to heat buildings. ADVERTISEMENT Heat pump mini split system next to home with painted brick wall and space for text copy getty Induction stoves are also highly efficient, with about 90% of the electrical energy transferred to directly heat pots and pans. Hydrogen stoves would be around 30% efficient after losing energy from electrolysis and again by indirectly heating food when much of the combustion heat escapes. Induction stoves also perform far better than today\u2019s gas and electric resistance stoves, with impeccable temperature control and the ability to boil water in minutes. Public health is another important consideration. We know natural gas stoves leak methane indoors even when turned off and release harmful toxins like nitrous oxides (NOx) and formaldehyde when burned. These emissions harm health and climate alike, with one study finding children in homes with gas stoves have a 42% increased risk of developing asthma symptoms. Hydrogen emits even more NOx than natural gas when burned, which would likely exacerbate this problem if utilities blend or switch to hydrogen. Induction and electric stoves avoid combustion altogether, improving family health. ADVERTISEMENT Getting it right the first time Regulators should be highly skeptical of utilities seeking ratepayer funds to blend hydrogen into gas distribution systems as part of a decarbonization strategy\u2014especially with proven ways of slashing near-term emissions, like reducing methane leaks from pipelines or funding building efficiency and electrification. State policymakers should look to reduce gas demand via building electrification. For example, the Colorado legislature recently passed a \u201cClean Heat Standard\u201d directing the state\u2019s regulated gas utilities to file emissions reduction plans with state regulators, and permitting gas utilities to use \u201cnon-pipes alternatives,\u201d such as replacing gas with electric equipment. However, regulatory oversight is needed to prevent utilities from promoting pathways that do not meaningfully reduce emissions, protect public safety, or ensure consumers don\u2019t get left with the bill for stranded assets. State policymakers should also advance electrification by adopting all-electric building codes for new construction, funding rebates for efficient electric appliances and heating equipment, and providing additional assistance to low-income customers. Together, these policies can kickstart an intentional transition, driving down electric equipment costs and capitalizing on their higher performance. ADVERTISEMENT Green hydrogen may have an important role in the clean energy economy, but we need not force its use in buildings. Electrification can decarbonize our buildings today while delivering affordable, safe, reliable, and higher-quality services. Let\u2019s not waste our time and money looking elsewhere.",

However, levels of air pollution in London are still too high for many people. The London public has become more active in pointing out the adverse effects of air pollution in recent years. For instance, in December 2020, nine-year-old Ella Kissi-Debrah became the first person in the United Kingdom whose cause of death was listed as \u201cair pollution,\u201d thanks to her mother\u2019s efforts.\u00a0 Ella died in London in 2013 after suffering from severe asthma attacks, leading to nearly 30 hospital visits in the last two years of her life. Her lungs collapsed and partially collapsed on at least five occasions before her death. Hertz\u2019s Tesla order for 100k vehicles included Model Ys, which will be available in late April Breathe with Tesla Model 3s The Breathe fleet is estimated to prevent 338 tonnes of CO2 from being released into the atmosphere per year. The service provider plans to replace existing petrol, diesel, and hybrid vehicles for an all-electric platform in London by 2025. MEEF\u2019s support for the project will help the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, attain his goal for zero emission transport in the capital. \u201cThe Mayor has set the ambitious targets to make London net zero carbon by 2030 and protect Londoners from toxic air pollution. This project is another great example of how the Mayor of London\u2019s Energy Efficiency Fund is supporting schemes that help deliver these goals, and how London can accelerate climate action through a combination of public and private sector investment,\u201d said Shirley Rodrigues, Deputy Mayor for Environment and Energy.

            "content": "Fit, fabric and design affect mask effectiveness. (Windsor Essex Sewing Force), Author providedEarly in the pandemic, mask-wearing policies were consistently associated with decreased transmission of SARS-CoV-2. At that time, the masks worn were generally made of cloth and often improvised. The highly-transmissible Omicron variant focused attention on mask performance. Although most provinces are lifting official mask mandates, we agree with public health authorities in recommending that people wear the best mask available. We have been working to improve and test reusable masks for community use. We are an interdisciplinary group of engineers, scientists, a doctor and a community mask-maker. We test novel personal protective equipment (PPE), advocate for mask use and summarize the best available evidence at clothmasks.org. Hierarchy of mask performance There is an accepted hierarchy of mask performance based on mask materials, certification standards and use, confirmed by a 2022 California population health study. The best protection is obtained by wearing a respirator such as an N95, CAN95 or CAN99, or in Europe, an FFP2 or FFP3. Performance is typically lower for KN95s, KF94s and certified medical masks meeting ASTM levels 1 to 3. (ASTM is an international standards organization.) Testing Essex-pleated cotton masks using a PortaCount fit tester at McMaster University. (Drouillard et. al. PLOS), Author provided The materials used in all these masks offer similar, excellent, aerosol filtration, but the masks differ in their fit and seal on the face, with KN95s and KF94s fitting better than certified medical masks. Cloth masks are typically ranked lower in their performance and may or may not be certified (for example, meeting ASTM-F3502 standard). However, we recently showed that well-fitted cloth masks comprising high quality two-ply cotton material can perform as well as Level 1 medical masks. Fabric types Some examples of the variations in fabric structure seen with scanning electron microscopy: A) Bandana, B) High quality quilting fabric, C) Tea towel, D) Bed sheet, E) Outer layer L1 nonwoven medical mask, F) Middle layer of L1 nonwoven medical mask. We found that pore diameter (the size of the gaps) and fabric weight predicted filtration, however consumers would not know the pore diameter for retail or wholesale cloth. For this reason, we focus on the categories used when cloth is sold, and recommend 100 per cent cotton quilters\u2019 fabric, fashion fabric and T-shirt fabric. (Drouillard et. al. PLOS), Author provided When health-care professionals are issued N95s or other certified respirators, they are fit tested to verify mask performance on the wearer. But fit testing is typically not an option for the public. Our research, explained in plain language here, underscores that fit can be achieved by good design and is as important as mask materials. For our research, we adapted the same method used in quantitative mask fit testing: a PortaCount fit tester that counts particles inside and outside the mask. We tested 16 different cottons from nine recognizable categories. All except bandana cotton showed filtration equivalent to a medical mask. These findings apply to the carefully designed two-layer cloth mask with ties we used \u2014 other masks that fit less well will not provide the same protection. Our results show that two-layer cotton masks made from quilters\u2019 cotton, fashion fabric and T-shirt fabric filtered 55 to 60 per cent of aerosol particles measuring one micron or smaller, the size relevant for infectious aerosol particles. This was similar to the performance of a Level 1 medical mask. The breathability of the two-layer cotton masks was also acceptable as per medical mask standards. This graph shows the filtration of two-layer masks, all the same design, worn by a human volunteer. All except bandana cotton showed filtration equivalent to a medical mask. Mass market QC = mass market quilting cotton, HQ QC = high quality quilting cotton, HQ Batik = high quality batik quilting fabric. The medical masks we tested are represented by dotted lines showing their 50 to 60 per cent filtration. (Drouillard et. al. PLOS), Author provided Filtration in the same range was provided by batiks, home d\u00e9cor fabric and bed-sheet fabric, but some examples of these materials failed the breathability testing. Tea towel fabrics also filtered well, but some were too thick to sew. Bandana fabrics performed worst at 46 per cent filtration. Fit and design A close fit at the ear prevents unfiltered air from entering the mask at the sides. (Drouillard et. al. PLOS), Author provided Our research showed that cloth masks performed similarly to medical masks because they fit better, were designed thoughtfully and had overhead ties. Although medical masks are composed of materials with better filtration performance, they exhibit greater leakage, with completely unfiltered air passing around the mask. As a test of breathability, we measured the pressure across fabrics using the same methods that are used for testing certified medical masks. The threshold for medical masks is shown with dotted lines. (Drouillard et. al. PLOS), Author provided The cloth masks included in past studies may have been haphazardly selected: their filtration, using the same methods that we used, was found to be between 23 and 52 per cent. A thoughtfully designed two-layer T-shirt mask with overhead ties, tested on human volunteers, filtered 50 per cent of aerosols, in keeping with our study, and again highlighting the importance of fit. To compare like with like, when we looked at other studies, the filtration percentages that we quote above were taken from studies using a similar design: protection of a human wearer, using particles 0.02 to 3 microns, 0.02 to 1 microns and 0.02 to 0.1 microns. Other studies examining source control, using mannikins and using larger particles come to similar conclusions. Good masks fit well, with minimal obvious leaking at the edges. Nosewires, overhead ties or earloop adjusters all contribute to fit. Two layers or more, and a middle layer of non-woven polypropylene improve overall filtration. Masks meeting the new U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention standard for community masks, ASTM-F3502, are likely to filter well, though generally not as well as respirators. N95 masks Hospitals report that the current supply of N95-type masks meets but doesn\u2019t exceed demand, and supply of these masks is insufficient for the general population. Access and cost issues require public health and economic solutions along with consideration of environmental impact of disposable PPE. If buying respirators for personal use, we recommend buying only what you need and practising extended reuse. If buying KN95s and equivalent certified medical masks, we advise paying close attention to the fit of the mask. We recommend double masking medical masks or using minor modifications or mask hacks that enhance fit and reduce leakage. Pattern and instructions for the Essex pleated mask \u2014 a two-layer, three-pleat design created by the Windsor-Essex Sewing Force \u2014 are available from wesf.ca. (Windsor Essex Sewing Force), Author provided Carefully designed, well-fitting, multilayer reusable cloth masks still have an important ongoing role in reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, especially in lower risk settings. Protection is highest and transmission is lowest when everyone wears masks, because masks both protect the wearer while also reducing the number of contaminated particles reaching the environment (source control). There are important reductions to individual risk from wearing any mask, which have been observed in the community and quantified in the lab. We can protect ourselves, others and vulnerable people. Let\u2019s all wear the best mask available.

Other studies examining source control , using mannikins and using larger particles come to similar conclusions. Good masks fit well, with minimal obvious leaking at the edges. Nosewires, overhead ties or earloop adjusters all contribute to fit . Two layers or more, and a middle layer of non-woven polypropylene improve overall filtration. Masks meeting the new U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention standard for community masks, ASTM-F3502 , are likely to filter well, though generally not as well as respirators. Hospitals report that the current supply of N95-type masks meets but doesn\u2019t exceed demand, and supply of these masks is insufficient for the general population. Access and cost issues require public health and economic solutions along with consideration of environmental impact of disposable PPE. If buying respirators for personal use, we recommend buying only what you need and practising extended reuse . If buying KN95s and equivalent certified medical masks, we advise paying close attention to the fit of the mask. We recommend double masking medical masks or using minor modifications or mask hacks that enhance fit and reduce leakage. Carefully designed , well-fitting , multilayer reusable cloth masks still have an important ongoing role in reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, especially in lower risk settings. Protection is highest and transmission is lowest when everyone wears masks , because masks both protect the wearer while also reducing the number of contaminated particles reaching the environment (source control). There are important reductions to individual risk from wearing any mask, which have been observed in the community and quantified in the lab . We can protect ourselves, others and vulnerable people. Let\u2019s all wear the best mask available.

            "full_description": "International Team of Scientists Finds that Hydration of the Nose, Larynx and Trachea by Salt Aerosols In COVID-19 Infected Patients Increases Oxygen Saturation Relative to Nasal Saline Control BOSTON and MARBURG/LAHN, Germany and BANGALORE, India , March 29, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Sensory Cloud, makers of FEND , announced today new clinical research findings by an international team of scientists at Bangalore Baptist Hospital, Harvard University , Massachusetts General Hospital, Research Triangle Institute, University Leicester, GS BIO-INHALATION and Sensory Cloud Inc. published in Scientific Reports which shows how airway hygiene with calcium-rich hypertonic salts (FEND) reduces symptoms of COVID-19. The study examined how symptoms of COVID-19 were impacted by hydration of the upper airways. The findings show that while respiratory droplet generation increases by up to 4 orders of magnitude in dehydrated associated states of advanced age, elevated BMI-age, strenuous exercise, and SARS-CoV-2 infection, targeted hydration of the nose, larynx and trachea with calcium-rich hypertonic salts (FEND) in COVID-19 positive patients decreases respiratory droplet generation, increases oxygen saturation and reduces symptoms of disease relative to a nasal saline control. These new research findings showcase that hydration of the upper airways appears promising as a non-drug approach for reducing risks of respiratory diseases such as COVID-19. \"It is well understood that the breathing of dry air augments risks of respiratory diseases ranging from asthma to COVID-19,\" said Bangalore Baptist Hospital's Carol Elizabeth George , MD, first author of the article. \"Many studies have also shown the respiratory health benefits of breathing clean moist air. In a world of dirty and dry air, the ability to confer the benefits of airway hydration with a hygienic rite as simple as the breathing of calcium-rich salt water three times a day has special healthcare relevance to communities like those I care for, where there is hardly any access to drugs, vaccines and basic hygiene, and where respiratory disease is the principal cause of death and morbidity.\" \"We are honored to be working with extraordinary individuals like Dr. Carol Elizabeth George , I and other healthcare workers and scientists, to explore this new form of hygiene targeting the upper airways with hypertonic salts,\" said Dr. Dennis Ausiello , Director CATCH, Massachusetts General Hospital, Jackson Distinguished Professor of Clinical Medicine at Harvard Medical School . In a parallel clinical study reported by the authors that focused on exercise-induced dehydration, exhaled aerosol increased around 15-fold following one hour of exercise (between 0.5 to 1.0% whole body weight loss); these new findings point to a previously unknown factor that may contribute to the spread of COVID-19 in athletic circumstances and the elevated risk of respiratory infection illness among high-endurance athletes. \"Nasal salines have proven beneficial for thousands of years as a means of cleansing nasal mucus,\" said communicating author Dr. David Edwards , Harvard University Professor of the Practice of Bioengineering (2002-2019), and FEND inventor. \"We are finding that hydrating the larynx and trachea confers a more profound impact on respiratory hygiene, as upper airway clearance and oxygenation function are critically managed by a well-hydrated larynx and trachea.\" This new research shines a light on the impact of whole-body dehydration, which frequently accompanies COVID-19 and is a potential common underlying factor in phenotypical states such as advanced age and high BMI associated with heightened risk of disease.

            "content": "Trees scorched by the Caldor Fire smoulder in the Eldorado National Forest, Calif., Sept. 3, 2021. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong)A growing number of governments and companies are adopting net-zero greenhouse gas emissions targets. These targets often evoke nature as a way to store or remove carbon from the atmosphere to counter the climate effect of other emissions. For example, in 2019, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised Greta Thunberg that Canada would plant two billion trees by 2030, and investing in nature is now a key part of Canada\u2019s climate strategy. Forests, peat bogs, wetlands and other ecosystems remove carbon from the atmosphere via photosynthesis and store it in leaves, trunks and roots, and in the soil. But carbon storage in nature is likely temporary because it can be lost again due to either human activities or natural disturbances. In contrast, the climate effect of carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels is effectively permanent. If these efforts to increase natural carbon stocks are short-lived, is there any climate benefit? Our new research suggests that temporary nature-based carbon storage can help achieve our climate goals. However, the most tangible effect \u2014 a decrease in peak warming \u2014 would only occur if we also eliminate fossil fuel emissions. Nature-based climate solutions Nature-based climate solutions are actions that seek to reduce the amount of carbon in the atmosphere by increasing carbon storage in natural systems. Examples include reforestation, nature conservation and improved agricultural practices. They can contribute to climate mitigation by preventing emissions from human land-use activities, or by maintaining and enhancing natural processes that remove carbon from the atmosphere.

Disturbances like wildfire would cause carbon to be lost back to the atmosphere. Conflicting human land-use priorities can also cause previously protected natural areas to be threatened by industrial activities. If nature-based carbon storage is temporary, then its climate benefit would also be short-lived. We need to think about nature-based climate solutions in relation to other climate mitigation efforts to understand their true benefits. What if nature-based carbon storage is temporary? Carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels have climate effects that persist for centuries. In contrast, nature-based carbon removal will only have a climate effect for as long as the carbon remains stored. In our study, we set out to explore what temporary removal would mean for future climate. We used a climate model to simulate the climate response to temporary removal alongside two different future emissions scenarios. If emissions continue to increase until 2040, followed by gradual decline, global temperatures would rise throughout the century. In this scenario, nature-based carbon removal would only delay the occurrence of a particular warming level. In our highest removal scenario, sequestering a quarter of current annual emissions every year until 2050 only delays the time we reach 1.5 C by a year, and 2 C by eight years. Climate effect of temporary nature-based carbon removal. (Authors) However, if future emissions are decreased rapidly to net-zero by mid-century and then remain net-negative, global temperatures would peak around 1.6 C and then decline during the second half of the century. Here, temporary nature-based carbon removal would decrease the temperature peak by as much as a tenth of a degree. This might seem small, but it is an important and tangible climate benefit that will only occur if the world also succeeds in eliminating fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions over the coming decades. How should we think about nature-based climate solutions? Our results challenge the way nature-based climate solutions are discussed as a climate policy option. Nature-based solutions are often presented as one of many different ways that we could mitigate our impact on climate, and are seen as interchangeable with other climate actions. Alternately, nature-based solutions are used as offsets, explicitly held up as a substitute for other emissions reductions. Both of these framings are problematic. If nature-based carbon storage is temporary, then its climate effect is not equivalent to avoiding fossil fuel carbon dioxide emission. This means that treating nature-based carbon storage as an alternative to other emissions reductions will, at best, delay crossing temperature thresholds. At worst, this could lead to more emissions and long-term warming. Electric vehicles charge at street stations in Norway.

Even temporary nature-based carbon storage could have an important climate benefit. The case for better nature conservation and stewardship Our results reveal some of the risks of relying on nature-based climate solutions at the expense of other climate mitigation efforts. However, nature conservation and better stewardship of natural areas can also lead to other positive environmental outcomes. These environmental co-benefits, such as increased biodiversity and improved water and air quality, are also vital to climate resilience. Wetlands, including those that have been damaged and destroyed by peat mining, can be restored to improve carbon storage if managed properly. (Shutterstock) If done in partnership with Indigenous and other local communities, nature-based solutions could also have positive social co-benefits such as supporting livelihoods and cultural values. Taking a holistic view of nature-based climate solutions would help to realize these multiple benefits. It is critical that nature-based climate solutions are not presented as an alternative to other climate mitigation options. As a complementary action however, they could play an important role in meeting both climate and other sustainability goals. H.

            "full_description": "A growing number of governments and companies are adopting net-zero greenhouse gas emissions targets . These targets often evoke nature as a way to store or remove carbon from the atmosphere to counter the climate effect of other emissions. For example, in 2019, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised Greta Thunberg that Canada would plant two billion trees by 2030 , and investing in nature is now a key part of Canada\u2019s climate strategy . Forests, peat bogs, wetlands and other ecosystems remove carbon from the atmosphere via photosynthesis and store it in leaves, trunks and roots, and in the soil. But carbon storage in nature is likely temporary because it can be lost again due to either human activities or natural disturbances . In contrast, the climate effect of carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels is effectively permanent . If these efforts to increase natural carbon stocks are short-lived, is there any climate benefit? Our new research suggests that temporary nature-based carbon storage can help achieve our climate goals. However, the most tangible effect \u2014 a decrease in peak warming \u2014 would only occur if we also eliminate fossil fuel emissions. Nature-based climate solutions are actions that seek to reduce the amount of carbon in the atmosphere by increasing carbon storage in natural systems. Examples include reforestation, nature conservation and improved agricultural practices. They can contribute to climate mitigation by preventing emissions from human land-use activities, or by maintaining and enhancing natural processes that remove carbon from the atmosphere.

Al-Khowaiter said in the statement. Hyundai plans to cut its carbon emissions by 75 percent compared with 2019 levels by 2040 and targets to reach carbon neutrality, or net-zero carbon dioxide emissions, in 2045, said sources. Carbon neutrality can be achieved by either balancing carbon emissions with carbon removal or by cutting carbon emissions entirely. To achieve the aim, Hyundai plans to raise the ratio of EVs to 30 percent by 2030 and 80 percent by 2040 in global sales from the current 1.5 percent. (With inputs from IANS) Live TV #mute",

Cryptocurrencies now inhabit an increasingly prominent niche in the global financial landscape, offering \u201cpastime\u201d opportunities for young investors, channelling donations to Ukraine\u2019s war effort or simply providing cheaper and faster alternatives to mainstream banking. In Aotearoa New Zealand, the Reserve Bank recently decided to investigate crypto as part of a wider conversation about how New Zealanders will pay and save in the future. So far, crypto has benefited from light regulation in New Zealand, but it\u2019s essential we have a clear picture of all pros and cons, including the risk of criminal behaviour and climate change impacts. Cryptocurrencies offer a variety of investment and transaction benefits, but concerns about dangers are also growing. Crypto\u2019s volatile track record presents significant risk to investors (alongside significant reward) and the relative anonymity of Bitcoin, Ethereum and others is proving attractive to organised crime, money laundering and tax evasion. Read more: Crypto theft is on the rise. Here's how the crimes are committed, and how you can protect yourself To date, crypto has largely avoided the traditional forms of financial regulation banks face and it has capitalised on its ability to eschew territorial borders, being everywhere and nowhere at once. As calls for effective regulation get louder and major markets in the US, EU and Asia seek to subject crypto to greater oversight, it is particularly important to highlight crypto\u2019s growing but often hidden environmental impact. Bitcoin uses more energy than most countries How do companies with only virtual assets contribute to environmental damage? The answer is data mining. Cryptocurrencies and assets use blockchain technology. In essence, transactions are verified and recorded on a blockchain, a public digital ledger that contains information about all transactions. Blockchain technology ensures the integrity of crypto transactions, but it does so by using huge amounts of electricity. Bitcoin\u2019s annual electricity consumption is more than three times that of New Zealand. This is due to blockchain\u2019s distributed nature and use of cryptography and complex processing, which require considerable computational power. Read more: Bitcoin: China's crackdown isn't enough \u2013 only a global effort can stop crypto's monstrous energy demand Verifying transactions, or mining, is so energy intensive it has caused concerns about the resilience of some countries\u2019 electricity supply. Earlier this year, Kazakhstan cut off crypto miners because of the country\u2019s energy crisis. When the electricity used by crypto comes from fossil fuels, the connection to climate change becomes clearer. Recent developments in the US are setting a worrying trend. Crypto\u2019s colossal energy needs may be met by electricity from coal-fired power stations, at a time when the energy sector should pivot towards renewables. In Kentucky, a new crypto \u201cblockchain farm\u201d is being built close to four coal-fired power plants, for easy energy supply. Meanwhile, another coal-fired power station in Montana has been brought back from the brink of closure after agreeing to act as the sole electricity supplier to a Bitcoin mining company, Marathon, adding hundreds of thousands of tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Cryptocurrencies and climate change The need to act decisively on climate change has never been more urgent. Last year, New Zealand announced its new Nationally Determined Contribution to cut emissions by 50% on 2005 levels by 2030 as part of collective efforts to limit global temperature rise to 1.5\u2103 above pre-industrial levels. This is an improvement on the previous pledge, but Climate Action Tracker still rates New Zealand\u2019s overall contribution to climate change mitigation as \u201chighly insufficient\u201d. The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), released last month, details the impacts of overshooting the 1.5\u2103 target. For Australasia, these include increased heat-related deaths and disease for people and wildlife, loss of livelihoods and a drop in income from agriculture and loss of low-lying coastal areas as a result of rising sea levels. Insufficient action on climate change now will have serious consequences, including close to home. According to a recent survey, most New Zealanders accept the need to take action to combat climate change. But all too often people\u2019s lifestyle decisions still seem disconnected from their environmental impacts. Confusion remains around what people can meaningfully do to make positive change.

A variety of mechanical and chemical innovations delivered during the 1950s and 1960s represented the third agricultural revolution. The adoption of pesticides, fertilisers and high-yield crop breeds, among other measures, transformed agriculture and ensured a secure food supply for many millions of people over several decades. Concurrently, modern agriculture has emerged as a culprit of global warming, responsible for one-third of greenhouse gas emissions, namely carbon dioxide and methane. Meanwhile, inflation on the price of food is reaching an all-time high, while malnutrition is rising dramatically. Today, an estimated two billion people are afflicted by food insecurity (where having access to safe, sufficient and nutrient-rich food isn\u2019t guaranteed). Some 690 million people are undernourished. The third agricultural revolution may have run its course. And as we search for innovation to usher in a fourth agricultural revolution with urgency, all eyes are on artificial intelligence (AI).

Read more: Smart labels and allergy sensors \u2013 how to make sure the future of food is ethical Using AI in agriculture In assisting humans in fields and factories, AI may process, synthesise and analyse large amounts of data steadily and ceaselessly. It can outperform humans in detecting and diagnosing anomalies, such as plant diseases, and making predictions including about yield and weather. Across several agricultural tasks, AI may relieve growers from labour entirely, automating tilling (preparing the soil), planting, fertilising, monitoring and harvesting. Algorithms already regulate drip-irrigation grids, command fleets of topsoil-monitoring robots, and supervise weed-detecting rovers, self-driving tractors and combine harvesters. A fascination with the prospects of AI creates incentives to delegate it with further agency and autonomy. This technology is hailed as the way to revolutionise agriculture. The World Economic Forum, an international lobbying organisation based in Switzerland, has set AI and AI-powered agricultural robots (called \u201cagbots\u201d) at the forefront of the fourth agricultural revolution. Agricultural AI could transform the way farmers work. Hryshchyshen Serhii/Shutterstock But in deploying AI swiftly and widely, we may increase agricultural productivity at the expense of safety. In our recent paper published in Nature Machine Intelligence, we have considered the risks that could come with rolling out these advanced and autonomous technologies in agriculture. From hackers to accidents First, given these technologies are connected to the internet, criminals may try to hack them. Disrupting certain types of agbots would cause hefty damages. In the US alone, soil erosion costs US$44 billion (\u00a333.6 billion) annually. This has been a growing driver of the demand for precision agriculture, including swarm robotics, that can help farms to manage and lessen its effects. But these swarms of topsoil-monitoring robots rely on interconnected computer networks and hence are vulnerable to cyber-sabotage and shutdown. Similarly, tampering with weed-detecting rovers would let weeds loose at a considerable cost. We might also see interference with sprayers, autonomous drones or robotic harvesters, any of which could cripple cropping operations. Beyond the farm gate, with increasing digitisation and automation, entire agrifood supply chains are susceptible to malicious cyber-attacks. At least 40 malware and ransomware attacks targeting food manufacturers, processors and packagers were registered in the US in 2021. The most notable was the US$11 million ransomware attack against the world\u2019s largest meatpacker, JBS. Read more: Our food system is at risk of crossing 'environmental limits' \u2013 here's how to ease the pressure Then there are accidental risks. Before a rover is sent into the field, it\u2019s instructed by its human operator to sense certain parameters and detect particular anomalies, such as plant pests. It disregards, whether by its own mechanical limitations or by command, all other factors. The same applies to wireless sensor networks deployed in farms, designed to notice and act on particular parameters, for example, soil nitrogen content. By imprudent design, these autonomous systems might prioritise short-term crop productivity over long-term ecological integrity. To increase yields, they might apply excessive herbicides, pesticides and fertilisers to fields, which could have harmful effects on soil and waterways. Rovers and sensor networks may also malfunction, as machines occasionally do, sending commands based on erroneous data to sprayers and agrochemical dispensers. And there\u2019s the possibility we could see human error in programming the machines. There are risks associated with using AI to grow our food. rsimona/Shutterstock Safety over speed Agriculture is too vital a domain for us to allow hasty deployment of potent but insufficiently supervised and often experimental technologies. If we do, the result may be that they intensify harvests but undermine ecosystems. As we emphasise in our paper, the most effective method to treat risks is prediction and prevention. We should be careful in how we design AI for agricultural use and should involve experts from different fields in the process. For example, applied ecologists could advise on possible unintended environmental consequences of agricultural AI, such as nutrient exhaustion of topsoil, or excessive use of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilisers. Also, hardware and software prototypes should be carefully tested in supervised environments (called \u201cdigital sandboxes\u201d) before they are deployed more widely. In these spaces, ethical hackers, also known as white hackers, could look for vulnerabilities in safety and security. This precautionary approach may slightly slow down the diffusion of AI. Yet it should ensure that those machines that graduate the sandbox are sufficiently sensitive, safe and secure. Half a billion farms, global food security and a fourth agricultural revolution hang in the balance.

Read more: Our food system is at risk of crossing 'environmental limits' \u2013 here's how to ease the pressure Then there are accidental risks. Before a rover is sent into the field, it\u2019s instructed by its human operator to sense certain parameters and detect particular anomalies, such as plant pests. It disregards, whether by its own mechanical limitations or by command, all other factors. The same applies to wireless sensor networks deployed in farms, designed to notice and act on particular parameters, for example, soil nitrogen content. By imprudent design, these autonomous systems might prioritise short-term crop productivity over long-term ecological integrity. To increase yields, they might apply excessive herbicides, pesticides and fertilisers to fields, which could have harmful effects on soil and waterways. Rovers and sensor networks may also malfunction, as machines occasionally do, sending commands based on erroneous data to sprayers and agrochemical dispensers. And there\u2019s the possibility we could see human error in programming the machines. Agriculture is too vital a domain for us to allow hasty deployment of potent but insufficiently supervised and often experimental technologies. If we do, the result may be that they intensify harvests but undermine ecosystems. As we emphasise in our paper , the most effective method to treat risks is prediction and prevention. We should be careful in how we design AI for agricultural use and should involve experts from different fields in the process. For example, applied ecologists could advise on possible unintended environmental consequences of agricultural AI, such as nutrient exhaustion of topsoil, or excessive use of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilisers. Also, hardware and software prototypes should be carefully tested in supervised environments (called \u201c digital sandboxes \u201d) before they are deployed more widely. In these spaces, ethical hackers, also known as white hackers, could look for vulnerabilities in safety and security. This precautionary approach may slightly slow down the diffusion of AI. Yet it should ensure that those machines that graduate the sandbox are sufficiently sensitive, safe and secure. Half a billion farms , global food security and a fourth agricultural revolution hang in the balance. Read more: Six big digital trends to watch in 2022",

            "description": "As the weather warms up, it's time for aspiring pit masters to dust off their aprons and meat probes before heading outside for some low-and-slow cooking. Pellet grills have become a popular choice for backyard cooks as they offer the flavor of food cooked over wood with a much more convenient fuel source. However, you still have to go outside to use one, and unless you have a screened-in porch or shelter of some kind, cooking in the rain is no fun. And if you live in an apartment, chances are you can't have a grill in the first place. FirstBuild, a product innovation lab backed by GE Appliances, has built Arden: an indoor smoker that burns wood pellets and \"eliminates\" the smoke so it's safe to use in your kitchen.Like an outdoor pellet grill, the Arden has a hopper for the fuel and burns it to produce smoke to flavor foods. The difference here is this countertop unit has a separate heating element that helps to regulate the temperature so it's not solely relying on burning pellets to cook. FirstBuild says the Arden circulates smoke around the chamber before a \"game-changing smoke-elimination technology\" uses \"a catalyst\" to get rid of it. The company explains that the small appliance doesn't have a filter you need to clean or replace, it just expels carbon dioxide and water vapor out of the back. Details are scarce on exactly what happens during that process, but it's clear the thing doesn't emit any smoke during a cook.FirstBuild is using smoke elimination tech here that was built for the Monogram Smart Hearth Oven. That appliance is an in-wall electric unit that's designed to mimic the performance of wood-fired brick ovens used in restaurants for pizza, baking and roasting. The company says the idea for a smoker was first implemented in an old GE fridge that had been converted to a BBQ cooker. In order to bring the device indoors to escape the weather, FirstBuild team outfitted it with the smoke trapping tech from the Hearth Oven.\u00a0The company says the smoker generated a ton of interest from its community so it asked if people would buy one and how big it needed to be. The first answer was a resounding \"yes,\" and the second was that it needed to fit on the counter like other kitchen appliances. Unlike the old refrigerator, the Arden is a moveable unit, so you can stash it somewhere else when its not in use \u2014 unless you really want to dedicate counter space to showing it off. Despite easy moving, it's still quite a large thing to have out all of the time.The Arden is about the size of a mini fridge with enough capacity for two racks of ribs, a small brisket or \"an average-sized\" pork butt. The device can also accommodate a whole chicken standing up on a rack or beer can. Three removable shelves allow you to fit things as needed, but based on FirstBuild's videos, you'll need to cut racks of ribs in half to make them fit. Cook times remain the same as outdoor smokers, so you're looking at three to five hours for ribs and up to 12 hours for a pork butt, for example. The Arden cooks at temperatures between 185-300 degrees Fahrenheit and it allows you to use a meat probe to monitor internal temp. It can also hold foods at a certain temperature once they're done cooking in case you can't get to them immediately.\u00a0Since the Arden has separate heat sources for the pellets and the main heat setting, FirstBuild says the device offers more accurate overall temperature. The company says this smoker also uses a lot less pellets since they smolder for flavor instead of burning to heat an entire grill. While barbecuers seem to be impressed by the smoker flavor the Arden prototypes impart, Mad Scientist BBQ's Jeremy Yoder noted that it's not as \"complex\" in the overall profile.\u00a0According to Yoder, the smoke flavor is more on the surface, so while you can certainly taste it, it hasn't penetrated the meat like hardwood coals or a full-size pellet grill can manage (BBQ nerds will also notice the lack of a well-defined smoke ring). Yoder did confirm that the results on pork ribs are a massive improvement over what you can get faking it in a regular oven, and they were even better than what he'd had in some restaurants. There is a smoke level adjustment on the Arden control panel, so presumably you could dial that up to fit your desired taste profile. Speaking of smoke, it's unclear if the smoker stops smoldering pellets temporarily if you open the door during the cooking process.\u00a0Like it has in the past, FirstBuild is taking the crowdfunding approach for initial pre-orders. If you snag one via Indiegogo, the earliest devotees can secure it for $599. After that, you'll get a $400 discount off the expected MSRP when the Arden goes on sale ($699 vs. $1,099). Prices will go up during the course of the campaign, so opting in sooner will save you some cash. The only downside to ordering early is backers will have to wait until summer 2023 to get one. However, the product lab crowdfunded the initial launch of the Opal Nugget Ice Maker in 2015 \u2014 raising over $2.5 million \u2014 so it has a history of delivering the goods. GE now offers a range of Opal machines, so it will be interesting to see what happens if the Arden hits or surpasses that mark.\u00a0",

Oxygen was not expected in a cometary environment because the gas is reactive and the sheer quantity detected suggested that current theories of the chemistry of the early solar system could be wrong. Now, however, a new analysis of the Rosetta data suggests that the 2015 observations are not that surprising after all. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-3759129-1'); }); In this latest work, a team led by Adrienn Luspay-Kuti at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in the US conclude that the oxygen detected around 67P comes from two internal reservoirs in the comet \u2013 and is not indicative of overly large amounts of the molecule in the object. \u201cWe discovered that the oxygen concentration in the comet, which everyone thought was super high, isn\u2019t quite as high after all,\u201d Luspay-Kuti told Physics World. \u201cWe are still not sure how exactly the oxygen got into the comet, but we made a huge leap forward in figuring it out,\u201d she adds. Tied up with water Previous attempts at explaining the high oxygen measurement had focussed on the observation that oxygen and water were present together in the coma. The conclusion reached by some scientists was that oxygen got tied up with water at the birth of the solar system and was then incorporated into 67P. Another possibility is that the oxygen was derived from water within the comet. However, these scenarios have significant conceptual problems, including why such high levels of oxygen were present when the comet was forming or how large amounts of oxygen can be produced in a comet. To understand the relationship with water, Luspay-Kuti and her colleagues studied seasonal variations in oxygen levels around 67P. Like Earth, the comet spins on an axis that is tilted with respect to its orbit around the Sun. This means that the surface of 67P experiences distinct seasons as it orbits the Sun once every 6.5 years. The team looked at parts of the comet at key time intervals when the seasons changed from winter to spring and then from summer to autumn. This allowed them to study outgassing, which occurs when the icy body of a comet is warmed and releases gases into the coma. The team found that oxygen and water were emitted when the surface of the comet was warm, but that the association between water and oxygen went away as the surface cooled. Instead, oxygen is linked with carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide during the cold season. Staggered emission The team concluded that they were observing the staggered emission of oxygen from two different reservoirs. They reckon that one reservoir is deep within the comet and contains oxygen that has been there since the comet was formed. The second reservoir is near the surface and is made of porous frozen water. The idea is that some of the oxygen escaping from the core becomes trapped temporarily in the frozen water reservoir. But then in the summer, some of this oxygen is released along with water as the ice heats up \u2013 creating the observed high oxygen levels in the coma. \u201cOnly one of these reservoirs, the one that\u2019s deep down the comet, is a window to the times before planet formation, whereas the other one is a secondary reservoir closer to the surface that temporarily withholds, traps and accumulates the oxygen,\u201d she adds. \u201cThis latter reservoir is responsible for the apparent close link between oxygen and water and for the very high oxygen concentrations.\u201d She adds that their analysis suggests that the oxygen deep within the comet has been there since the comet formed.

            "content": "The ocean retains heat for much longer than land does. Aliraza Khatri's Photography via Getty ImagesGlobal warming doesn\u2019t stop on a dime. If people everywhere stopped burning fossil fuels tomorrow, stored heat would still continue to warm the atmosphere. Picture how a radiator heats a home. Water is heated by a boiler, and the hot water circulates through pipes and radiators in the house. The radiators warm up and heat the air in the room. Even after the boiler is turned off, the already heated water is still circulating through the system, heating the house. The radiators are, in fact, cooling down, but their stored heat is still warming the air in the room. This is known as committed warming. Earth similarly has ways of storing and releasing heat. Emerging research is refining scientists\u2019 understanding of how Earth\u2019s committed warming will affect the climate. Where we once thought it would take 40 years or longer for global surface air temperature to peak once humans stopped heating up the planet, research now suggests temperature could peak in closer to 10 years. But that doesn\u2019t mean the planet returns to its preindustrial climate or that we avoid disruptive effects such as sea level rise. I am a professor of climate science, and my research and teaching focus on the usability of climate knowledge by practitioners such as urban planners, public health professionals and policymakers. With a new report on mitigating climate change expected from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in early April, let\u2019s take a look at the bigger picture. How understanding of peak warming has changed Historically, the first climate models represented only the atmosphere and were greatly simplified. Over the years, scientists added oceans, land, ice sheets, chemistry and biology. Today\u2019s models can more explicitly represent the behavior of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide. That allows scientists to better separate heating due to carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from the role of heat stored in the ocean. Why global warming is ocean warming. Thinking about our radiator analogy, increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in Earth\u2019s atmosphere keep the boiler on \u2013 holding energy near the surface and raising the temperature. Heat accumulates and is stored, mostly in the oceans, which take on the role of the radiators. The heat is distributed around the world through weather and oceanic currents. The current understanding is that if all of the additional heating to the planet caused by humans was eliminated, a plausible outcome is that Earth would reach a global surface air temperature peak in closer to 10 years than 40. The previous estimate of 40 or more years has been widely used over the years, including by me. It is important to note that this is only the peak, when the temperature starts to stabilize \u2013 not the onset of rapid cooling or a reversal of climate change. I believe there is enough uncertainty to justify caution about exaggerating the significance of the new research\u2019s results. The authors applied the concept of peak warming to global surface air temperature. Global surface air temperature is, metaphorically, the temperature in the \u201croom,\u201d and is not the best measure of climate change. The concept of instantly cutting off human-caused heating is also idealized and entirely unrealistic \u2013 doing that would involve much more than just ending fossil fuel use, including widespread changes to agriculture \u2013 and it only helps illustrate how parts of the climate might behave. Even if the air temperature were to peak and stabilize, \u201ccommitted ice melting,\u201d \u201ccommitted sea level rise\u201d and numerous other land and biological trends would continue to evolve from the accumulated heat. Some of these could, in fact, cause a release of carbon dioxide and methane, especially from the Arctic and other high-latitude reservoirs that are currently frozen. For these reasons and others, it is important to consider the how far into the future studies like this one look. Oceans in the future Oceans will continue to store heat and exchange it with the atmosphere. Even if emissions stopped, the excess heat that has been accumulating in the ocean since preindustrial times would influence the climate for another 100 years or more. Because the ocean is dynamic, it has currents, and it will not simply diffuse its excess heat back into the atmosphere. There will be ups and downs as the temperature adjusts. The oceans also influence the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, because carbon dioxide is both absorbed and emitted by the oceans. Paleoclimate studies show large changes in carbon dioxide and temperature in the past, with the oceans playing an important role. The chart shows how excess heat \u2013 thermal energy \u2013 has built up in ocean, land, ice and atmosphere since 1960 and moved to greater ocean depths with time. TOA CERES refers to the top of the atmosphere. Karina von Schuckman, LiJing Cheng, Matthew D. Palmer, James Hansen, Caterina Tassone, et al., CC BY-SA Countries aren\u2019t close to ending fossil fuel use The possibility that a policy intervention might have measurable impacts in 10 years rather than several decades could motivate more aggressive efforts to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. It would be very satisfying to see policy interventions having present rather than notional future benefits. [Over 150,000 readers rely on The Conversation\u2019s newsletters to understand the world. Sign up today.] However, today, countries aren\u2019t anywhere close to ending their fossil fuel use. Instead, all of the evidence points to humanity experiencing rapid global warming in the coming decades. Our most robust finding is that the less carbon dioxide humans release, the better off humanity will be. Committed warming and human behavior point to a need to accelerate efforts both to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to this warming planet now, rather than simply talking about how much needs to happen in the future.

Paleoclimate studies show large changes in carbon dioxide and temperature in the past, with the oceans playing an important role. The possibility that a policy intervention might have measurable impacts in 10 years rather than several decades could motivate more aggressive efforts to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. It would be very satisfying to see policy interventions having present rather than notional future benefits.

Instead, all of the evidence points to humanity experiencing rapid global warming in the coming decades. Our most robust finding is that the less carbon dioxide humans release, the better off humanity will be. Committed warming and human behavior point to a need to accelerate efforts both to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to this warming planet now, rather than simply talking about how much needs to happen in the future.",

(Science Photo Library) Methane holds the key to finding alien life, according to new research. The powerful greenhouse gas is emitted by microbes. Most astronomers advocate looking for water and oxygen but the recently launched James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) can detect methane and is due to begin observations in the summer. The gas has been found wafting on Saturn\u2019s moons Titan and Enceladus. Co-author Dr Joshua Krissansen-Totton, of California University in Santa Cruz, said: \u2018If you detect a lot of methane on a rocky planet, you typically need a massive source to explain that. \u2018We know biological activity creates large amounts of methane on Earth, and probably did on the early Earth as well because making methane is a fairly easy thing to do metabolically.\u2019 It can be the source of methane in a rocky planet\u2019s atmosphere, the study shows. Lead author Maggie Thompson, a graduate student in the lab, said: \u2018Oxygen is often talked about as one of the best biosignatures, but it\u2019s probably going to be hard to detect with JWST.\u2019 The US team assessed the planetary conditions needed for methane to be a good biosignature. This Nasa artist\u2019s rendition shows the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in space (Credits: AFP) She said: \u2018We wanted to provide a framework for interpreting observations, so if we see a rocky planet with methane, we know what other observations are needed for it to be a persuasive biosignature.\u2019 Non-biological sources include volcanoes, ocean ridges, hydrothermal vents, tectonic subduction zones and comet or asteroid impacts. The case for methane as a biosignature stems from its instability in the atmosphere. Photochemical reactions destroy atmospheric methane. It must be steadily replenished to maintain high levels. Nonbiological sources would not be able to produce that much methane without also generating observable clues to its origins. They cannot easily produce habitable planet atmospheres rich in both methane and carbon dioxide and with little to no carbon monoxide. Outgassing from volcanoes, for example, would add both methane and carbon monoxide to the atmosphere. Biological activity tends to readily consume carbon monoxide. The study emphasises the need to consider the full planetary context. For a rocky planet orbiting a sun-like star, methane is more likely to indicate life if the atmosphere also has carbon dioxide. Ms Thompson said: \u2018One molecule is not going to give you the answer \u2013 you have to take into account the planet\u2019s full context. \u2018Methane is one piece of the puzzle, but to determine if there is life on a planet you have to consider its geochemistry, how it\u2019s interacting with its star, and the many processes that can affect a planet\u2019s atmosphere on geologic timescales.\u2019 The study considers a variety of possibilities for \u2018false positives\u2019 and provides guidelines for assessing methane biosignatures. Methane has been detected on Titan, the largest moon of Saturn (Credits: Getty) Dr Krissansen-Totton said: \u2018There are two things that could go wrong \u2013 you could misinterpret something as a biosignature and get a false positive, or you could overlook something that\u2019s a real biosignature. \u2018With this paper, we wanted to develop a framework to help avoid both of those potential errors with methane.\u2019 There is still a lot of work to be done to fully understand any future methane detections. He said: \u2018This study is focused on the most obvious false positives for methane as a biosignature. \u2018The atmospheres of rocky exoplanets are probably going to surprise us, and we will need to be cautious in our interpretations. \u2018Future work should try to anticipate and quantify more unusual mechanisms for non-biological methane production.\u2019 Titan has methane in its atmosphere and Enceladus has a liquid ocean with erupting plumes of gas and water.

            "content": "SEOUL, Korea \u2013 March 30, 2022 - Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. today showcased its 2022 lineup of Neo QLED 8K, soundbars, accessories and sustainability initiatives at its virtual Unbox & Discover event. With this new lineup, Samsung aims to redefine the role of television by creating beautifully designed, cutting-edge screens that offer more than just entertainment. This year's products and features take the screen to new heights by providing one central hub to play, connect, work and more. \"We are focused on creating a seamless experience across all of our products, which allows consumers to effortlessly enjoy all their benefits. The 2022 Neo QLED 8K is designed to fulfill the needs and empower the passion of our consumers, and the innovations are sparked by their experiences,\" said Jong-Hee(JH) Han, Vice Chairman, CEO and Head of Samsung Electronics' DX (Device eXperience) Division. \"Neo QLED 8K also has the power to unlock new experiences as the most important device at the center of the home.\" Samsung's 2022 portfolio was developed from the vision of 'Screens Everywhere, Screens for All,' with TVs at the center of users' home and daily lives. In line with this vision, Samsung created devices that seamlessly connect to provide deep personalization and connectivity ensuring there is a screen fit for every occasion and lifestyle. Historically, TVs and screens have been mainly associated with the act of \"watching,\" but Neo QLED 8K aims to change this by expanding the user experience. Neo QLED 8K: The Best Gets BetterThe 2022 Neo QLED 8K has been upgraded to bring the large screen experience to another level. At the heart is the Neural Quantum Processor 8K. The latest processor has 20 independent neural AI networks, each analyzing the content's characteristics and picture quality for optimal viewing, regardless of the source. The Neural Quantum Processor 8K also powers a new technological innovation \u2013 Real Depth Enhancer. This scans the screen, and maximizes contrast with the background by enhancing the object while keeping the background unprocessed. It works similarly to the way human eyes perceive images in real life so the object on screen stands out against the background. The processor, combined with the powerful Quantum Mini LEDs, creates lighting that is precise and controlled so bright areas stay bright and the dark space around it stays dark \u2013 a feature we have dubbed Shape Adaptive Light Control. For example, the full moon will stay bright against the black night sky. In fact, Samsung's all new 2022 QLED received the world's first 'Pantone Validated' certification in display from Pantone, the global authority on color and creator of the Pantone Matching System (PMS) \u2013 meaning the models authentically reproduce more than 2,000 colors as well as the newly added 110 skin tone shades found in Pantone's guidelines. Additionally, these brilliant colors are comfortable to watch with the new EyeComfort Mode. The feature uses AI technology to automatically adjust the brightness and color temperature of the screen based on how light or dark the room is combined with the sunset/sunrise information to optimize the most comfortable viewing experience. Immersive Dolby Atmos Sound with Smart FeaturesFor true immersion, TVs and screens need powerful and nuanced sound to match the rich colors and sharp details. The Neural Quantum Processor 8K's AI analyzes what is on screen in real-time so that the Adaptive Sound features can track and move between speakers to precisely match the movement on screen. In QN900B, a flagship Neo QLED 8K model, all the sounds come from a 90W 6.2.4 channel audio system, featuring new top channel speakers and Dolby Atmos with Object Tracking Sound Pro. This technology has also been applied to voice recognition with Voice Tracking Sound, so that sound effects and voices truly follow the movement across the screen. Samsung is also introducing Wireless Dolby Atmos to its Neo QLED 4K and 8K TVs\u2013 this means pristine audio quality without the clutter of HDMI cables. Wireless Dolby Atmos will also be applied to Samsung's new 2022 Ultra Slim Soundbar, designed for an immersive audio experience from a more aesthetically at a minimal setup. Experiencing Your ScreenTo ensure the experience is as seamless as possible, the 2022 lineup is outfitted with new and smarter features and user interface, allowing Samsung TVs and screens to become the central hub to watch content, control devices, play games, work out and more. New Smart Hub: This year, Samsung also unveiled Smart Hub, its new user interface, powered by Tizen. The all-new Samsung Smart Hub brings every aspect of the smart experience into one easy-to-navigate home screen. The new tab classifies features, settings, and content into three categories for a seamless user experience: Media, Gaming Hub, and Ambient.Media: The Media screen organizes users' entertainment options \u2013 including video on demand, streaming, and Samsung TV Pluswith 190+ free channels \u2013 and learns users' preferences with machine learning to make smart recommendations across all platforms and services.Gaming Hub: Gaming Hub is a new game streaming discovery platform that bridges hardware and software to provide a seamless player experience. No downloads required, no storage needed. Samsung also announced partnerships with leading game streaming services \u2013 NVIDIA GeForce NOW, Stadia\u2122 and Utomik, with more to come \u2013 to bring their libraries of games to the Gaming Hub. The new platform will be available later this year on select 2022 Samsung Smart TV models.Ambient: The Ambient screen enhances the home's aesthetic, whether that means synchronizing the screen's display with its surrounding d\u00e9cor or making a bold statement with eye-catching art.Gaming Experience: In addition to the all-new Gaming Hub, the 2022 lineup comes with specifications and features that are made for the ultimate gaming experience. They include four HDMI 2.1 supporting ports, Motion Xcelerator Turbo Pro 4K 144Hz gaming, Super Ultrawide GameView and Game Bar, making gaming more efficient and accessible for a fast-paced and streamlined experience. With these incredible picture quality and settings improvements, games will be more realistic and thrilling than ever. Samsung is also introducing an exclusive TV lineup for gaming in 43 and 50 inches in the near future.Samsung Health: Samsung Health offers not only a wide variety of workout and wellness classes, but also ways to track your progress and routines. Users can easily track their fitness journey and activities on their TV and seamlessly sync with other devices such as Galaxy Watch4 Series to track progress in real-time on the screen.SmartThings: A critical component of the connected experience is Samsung's SmartThings. With SmartThings, the screen becomes the central hub to conveniently control other home devices at a single point. This feature, included in Samsung TVs, takes advantage of the large screen to help users discover, view and control devices at-a-glance.NFT Platform: Finally, new in 2022 is Samsung's NFT Platform, partnering with the industry leader, Nifty Gateway. Ambient mode will offer consumers a one-stop NFT platform to explore and display NFT digital arts on 2022 Neo QLED and QLEDs, a new way to collect and present art works. Sustainability at the Core with 'Going Green'Samsung is always thinking about how the manufacturing process and the use of products impact the Earth's environment, looking for ways to reduce its footprint and build a better future for the planet.Eco-Packaging: Samsung is improving its eco-conscious packaging with 90% less ink while also removing the staples during production. Both improvements reduce waste and make it easier for recycling centers to process.SolarCell Remote: The SolarCell remote also received an upgrade for 2022. It is 88% more efficient than the previous 2020 models. They are now completely battery-free and can now be charged through 2.4GHz Radio Frequency Harvesting \u2013 drawing power from spare energy emitted by Wi-Fi routers.Recycled Materials: Samsung's 2022 TVs, monitors, digital signage, and remote controls use recycled resin. Notably, high-resolution monitors use recycled resin from ocean-bound plastic recovered in coastal areas that would otherwise have become marine hazardous waste.The Carbon Trust certification: Samsung's Neo QLED 8K/4K has achieved the 'Reducing CO2' label from the Carbon Trust, demonstrating that the carbon footprint for the Neo QLED lineup is being reduced year over year. Making it Personal with AccessoriesEach consumer has their unique taste and needs when it comes to TVs, which is why Samsung created new accessories for its 2022 TVs that facilitate entirely new TV experiences.Slim Fit Wall Mount: For those who want to wall mount their screen, the Slim Fit Wall Mount allows the TV to lie flush against the wall while offering swivel up, down, and sideways for the perfect angle no matter where the viewer is seated.Studio Stand: In case the TV stand is preferred, the Studio Stand offers a unique and elegant way to display the Neo QLED 8K in an artistic fashion.Auto Rotation: The new accessory extends the rotating capabilities of The Sero to the Neo QLED 8K. Auto Rotation brings mobile experiences to the big screen, portrait art to the full screen, and MultiView experiences to new layouts. It can be used as a stand or wall mount so that whatever is on, the whole screen is filled to optimize the viewing experience.\u00a0",

            "content": "The European Union has announced a new bundle of sustainability-focused policy proposals that will expand existing ecodesign rules on energy efficiency by encouraging longer product lifespans, supporting the growth of circular economy business models and helping consumers combat greenwashing and make more environmentally friendly purchasing choices, as regional lawmakers work to make good on a Circular Economy Action Plan announced two years ago. The bloc\u2019s overarching European Green Deal plan has the stated goal of making the region \u201cclimate neutral\u201d by 2050. That mission translates to no net emissions of greenhouse gases within a timeframe of (now) just under three decades while decoupling the EU\u2019s economic growth from resource use \u2014 aka a shift to a circular economy where products are designed to last longer and also to be easy to disassemble for reuse or recycling at end of life. So there is, very clearly, lots of work for policymakers to do. Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine has only added to the urgency of the EU\u2019s climate mission \u2014 underscoring the case for the bloc to rapidly move away from using fossil fuels for energy and wider economic fuel as many Member States remain heavily reliant on oil and gas from Russia, leaving their economies exposed to the ongoing regional instability. In a press release announcing its latest sustainability policy package, the Commission suggests that, by 2030, the revised ecodesign framework could lead to 132 mtoe [million tonnes of oil equivalent] of primary energy savings \u2014 which it emphasizes is \u201calmost equivalent to EU\u2019s import of Russian gas\u201d (which corresponds to \u201croughly to 150 bcm [billion cubic meters] of natural gas\u201d). It is also keen to flag the value of existing EU ecodesign requirements (which are focused on energy efficiency) \u2014 saying they saved consumers \u20ac120BN and led to a 10% lower annual energy consumption by the products in scope. The latest proposals to slot under the EU\u2019s \u2018green deal\u2019 umbrella include an interesting idea for Digital Product Passports (see below) \u2014 which is part of a wider push to increase product sustainability via a Regulation on Ecodesign for Sustainable Products (aka ESPR). The latter sets new requirements to \u201cmake products more durable, reliable, reusable, upgradable, reparable, easier to maintain, refurbish and recycle, and energy and resource efficient\u201d; and looks set to apply across the board from products such as metals and textiles all the way up to mobile phones and tablets. \u201cThe objective of the Commission\u2019s Ecodesign proposal is to make sustainable products the norm on the EU market and reduce their overall environmental and climate impacts,\u201d the EU\u2019s executive writes, adding: \u201cThe \u2018take-make-use-dispose\u2019 model can be avoided, and much of a product\u2019s environmental impacts is determined at the design stage.\u201d The ecodesign proposal extends existing EU rules in this area to both broaden the scope of products covered by ecodesign regulations (the Commission says it wants almost all products to fall in scope in the future) and to broaden requirements on those products to encompass circularity and an overall reduction of products\u2019 environmental and climate footprint, in addition to energy efficiency criteria. So it\u2019s fair to say that the bloc\u2019s concept of \u2018ecodesign\u2019 is being radically redesigned \u2014 and, well, upgraded. The Commission argues that this broader ecodesign strategy will lead to more energy and resource independence and less pollution, and also anticipates it creating \u201ceconomic opportunities for innovation and job creation\u201d, especially in areas such as remanufacturing, maintenance, recycling and repair. So hot European startups of the future could be in areas like smarter waste management and upcycling. Specific per product requirements aren\u2019t clear, as yet, as the EU\u2019s approach starts with a big picture proposal for a framework and a process \u2014 via which the Commission (\u201cworking in close cooperation with all those concerned\u201d) will gradually set out requirements for each product or group of products, yielding specific stipulations down the line. Its approach also suggests there could end up being a degree of variability in requirements across different types of products, as various trade offs (perhaps product longevity vs energy efficiency of manufacture, say) are weighed up and variously assessed in each specific product context. (Variation may also creep in as a result of sector-specific lobbying ofc.) \u201cThese ecodesign requirements will be tailored to the particular characteristics of the product groups concerned,\u201d the Commission writes in a communication on the proposal. \u201cTheir identification and development will factor-in the potential for improvement and relative effectiveness in delivering increased resource and energy efficiency, enabling longer product life and maximising the value embedded in materials, reducing pollution and the overall impact of products on climate and the environment.\u201d In a list of sample ecodesign requirements which may apply to different types of products, the communication offers examples that include mandates to minimize waste (such as packaging waste); set a minimum level of recycled content that a product must contain; and require ease of disassembly, remanufacturing and recycling of products and materials, among others. \u201cOnly a few sectors, such as food, feed, and medicinal products, are exempted,\u201d the EU further specifies in a Q&A on the sustainable products initiative which also states that incoming ecodesign and labelling rules will cover product groups which are not regulated now, such as smartphones, tablets and photovoltaic solar systems. So gadgets look set to fall squarely in scope, along with almost every other type of non-edible thing and/or material used to make things which may be picked up off a shelf by or dropshipped to an EU consumer in the future (not to mention the packaging itself). Commenting in a statement, VirginijusSinkevi\u010dius, the EU commissioner for the environment, oceans and fisheries, said: \u201cOur circular economy proposals kick off an era where products will be designed in a way that brings benefits to all, respects the boundaries of our planet and protects the environment. Giving a longer lifespan to the phones we use, to the clothes we wear and to many other products will save money for European consumers. And at the end of their life products will not be a source of pollution but of new materials for the economy, decreasing the dependency of European businesses on imports.\u201d The Commission will launch a public consultation on the categories of products to be selected under the first ESPR working plan by the end of this year \u2014 but it suggests the first focus will be on product categories such as textiles, furniture, mattresses, tyres, detergents, paints, lubricants, and on intermediate products like iron, steel and aluminium, as it says these have \u201chigh environmental impact and potential for improvement\u201d. As the bloc expands ecodesign rules, repairability in general looks set to get a massive boost \u2014 again also for electronics, an area where the Commission already said (March 2020) it would be expanding requirements. \u201cWork has advanced significantly with assessing the feasibility of ecodesign requirements and an energy labelling scheme for mobile phones and tablets,\u201d it notes in a communication on its Ecodesign and Energy Labelling Working Plan, adopted today as a transitory measure \u201cto cover new energy-related products, update and increase the ambition for products that are already regulated\u201d until the expanded ecodesign regulation enters into force. \u201cThe requirements would be affecting energy efficiency as well as material efficiency (durability, reparability, upgradability and recycling) aspects. The regulations are expected to be adopted before the end of 2022,\u201d it goes on, adding: \u201cLikewise, work is well advanced to assess the feasibility of ecodesign requirements and energy labelling for solar photovoltaic modules, inverters and systems, including possible requirements on carbon footprint.\u201d Expanded EU ecodesign rules will apply equally to all products placed on the market, regardless of country of manufacture or importation, meaning gizmos made in Asia or the US that are intended for sale within the bloc won\u2019t be able to escape compliance with the sustainability requirements. European lawmakers propose a \u2018right to repair\u2019 for mobiles and laptops A Digital Product Passport for every thing Another part of the EU\u2019s plan for revised ecodesign rules includes a proposal to introduce Digital Product Passports to store key data to improve traceability around products and support repair/recycling etc by standardizing the information which product manufacturers must provide. The Commission also intends these passports to arm consumers with information on environmental impacts to inform purchasing decisions. This could include energy consumption info but also \u2014 via new EU Energy Labels for relevant products \u2014 a repairability score. \u201c[P]roduct-specific information requirements will ensure consumers know the environmental impacts of their purchases,\u201d the Commission suggests of the Digital Product Passport plan. \u201cAll regulated products will have Digital Product Passports. This will make it easier to repair or recycle products and facilitate tracking substances of concern along the supply chain. Labelling can be introduced as well.\u201d Digital product passports will be \u201cthe norm\u201d for all products regulated under the ESPR, per the Commission \u2014 with the goal to ensure that products are \u201ctagged, identified and linked to data relevant to their circularity and sustainability\u201d. \u201cThis proposal will\u2026 enable information requirements to be set for products to know more about the impacts of the products on our shelves and make more sustainable choices along the whole value chain,\u201d it adds. How exactly this will work isn\u2019t clear but presumably something like a QR code could be fixed to each product for scanning to view the associated sustainability data. \u201cDigital Product Passports will be rolled out for all regulated products,\u201d the Commission writes. \u201cThe product information can also take the form of \u2018classes of performance\u2019 \u2014 for instance ranging from \u2018A to G\u2019 \u2014 to facilitate comparison between products, possibly displayed in the form of a label. This would work in a manner similar to how the widely recognized EU Energy Label currently works, and be for instance used for a repairability score.\u201d The EU is also eyeing the potential for this standardized \u2018metadata\u2019 system to create other data-sharing opportunities \u2014 which could even lead to other types of business opportunity, or support additional pieces of sustainability legislation across the bloc. \u201cPioneering this approach for environmental sustainability data can also pave the way for wider voluntary data sharing, going beyond the products and requirements regulated under the ESPR,\u201d the Commission suggests. \u201cMoreover, product passports may be used for information on other sustainability aspects applicable to the relevant product group pursuant to other Union legislation.\u201d \u201cStructuring information on the environmental sustainability of products and transmitting it by means of digital product passports will help businesses along the value chain, from manufacturers, importers and distributors to dealers, repairers, remanufacturers and recyclers, to access information that is valuable in their work to improve environmental performance, prolong product lifetime, boost efficiency and the use of secondary raw materials, thus lowering the need for primary natural resources, saving costs and reducing strategic dependencies,\u201d it also argues. \u201cThis will also help track the presence of substances of concern throughout the life cycle of materials and products, following through on commitments made in the Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability and contributing to the EU\u2019s aim to achieve zero pollution. Digital product passports can also enable consumers to make more informed choices, improve transparency for public interest organisations and help national authorities in their enforcement and surveillance work.\u201d Other measures in the EU\u2019s ecodesign expansion proposal seek to end the destruction of unsold consumer goods \u2014 a practice that can be disturbingly widespread in ecommerce (hi Amazon!) and fashion, for example \u2014 through \u201cfar-reaching transparency requirements for those choosing to discard unsold goods, and the possibility to ban their destruction for relevant product groups\u201d. \u201c[L]arge businesses that discard unsold products will have to disclose their number per year, the reasons for the discarding and information on the amount of discarded products that they have delivered for preparing for re-use, remanufacturing, recycling, energy recovery and disposal operations in line with the waste hierarchy. They will have to ensure this information is made available, either on a freely accessible website, or via other means,\u201d the Commission writes. \u201cThis measure will apply to all concerned economic operators as soon as the regulation enters into force. The proposal explicitly prohibits circumvention techniques, such as a big company selling to small companies (which are normally exempted) to make them destroy products.\u201d Green public procurement will also be supported through mandatory criteria in the regulation. In addition, the Commission has presented two targeted sectoral initiatives today \u2014 one focused on sustainability and circularity of textiles, with the strategy there intended to make textiles \u201cmore durable, repairable, reusable and recyclable, to tackle fast fashion, textile waste and the destruction of unsold textiles, and ensure their production takes place in full respect of social rights\u201d by 2030; and another that aims to boost the internal market for construction products while also ensuring that the regulatory framework is geared towards sustainability and climate objectives. Both sectors have high carbon footprints. Sourceful grabs $20M to make more packaging less polluting EU lawmakers agree data reuse rules to foster AI and R&D",

            "full_description": "The European Union has announced a new bundle of sustainability-focused policy proposals that will expand existing ecodesign rules on energy efficiency by encouraging longer product lifespans, supporting the growth of circular economy business models and helping consumers combat greenwashing and make more environmentally friendly purchasing choices, as regional lawmakers work to make good on a Circular Economy Action Plan announced two years ago. The bloc\u2019s overarching European Green Deal plan has the stated goal of making the region \u201cclimate neutral\u201d by 2050. That mission translates to no net emissions of greenhouse gases within a timeframe of (now) just under three decades while decoupling the EU\u2019s economic growth from resource use \u2014 aka a shift to a circular economy where products are designed to last longer and also to be easy to disassemble for reuse or recycling at end of life. So there is, very clearly, lots of work for policymakers to do. Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine has only added to the urgency of the EU\u2019s climate mission \u2014 underscoring the case for the bloc to rapidly move away from using fossil fuels for energy and wider economic fuel as many Member States remain heavily reliant on oil and gas from Russia, leaving their economies exposed to the ongoing regional instability. In a press release announcing its latest sustainability policy package, the Commission suggests that, by 2030, the revised ecodesign framework could lead to 132 mtoe [million tonnes of oil equivalent] of primary energy savings \u2014 which it emphasizes is \u201calmost equivalent to EU\u2019s import of Russian gas\u201d (which corresponds to \u201croughly to 150 bcm [billion cubic meters] of natural gas\u201d). It is also keen to flag the value of existing EU ecodesign requirements (which are focused on energy efficiency) \u2014 saying they saved consumers \u20ac120BN and led to a 10% lower annual energy consumption by the products in scope.

            "content": "Acer Aspire Vero is making us rethink the possibilities of sustainable tech. Laptops are tragically not known for being eco-friendly, but just about every aspect of the engineering in the Vero portends a brighter future for tech that is planet-conscious with few compromises when it comes to performance. Here\u2019s a quick review of Acer Aspire Vero and its various features. Acer Aspire Vero Review: Is it Worth It? Specs: \u2014 Processor: Intel Core i5-1155G7 processor Quad-core 2.50 GHz \u2014 Memory: 256 GB \u2014 RAM: 8 GB, DDR4 SDRAM \u2014 Display Size: 15.6 inches \u2014 Weight: 3.97 pounds \u2014 Dimensions: 9.39 inches L x 14.31 inches W x 0.7 inches D \u2014 Operating System: Windows 11 Home \u2014 Ports: One USB Type-C, USB 3.2 Gen 1, Two USB 3.2 Gen 1, one USB 2.0, one HDMI 2.0, one 3.5 mm headphone/speaker jack, DC for AC adapter, one Ethernet Selected Features Made from PCR: Plastic is currently filling up landfills and forming entire islands in our oceans. Post-consumer recycled plastic (PCR) keeps the waste out of the dump and repurposes it into useful items, like laptops. From the screen bezel to the front and bottom cover, 30 percent of the Acer Aspire Vero laptop is made from PCR, along with 50 percent of the keycaps. Solid Design: Aspire Vero is durable, and built to the same standards as other Acer laptops. The attractive finish on the laptop doesn\u2019t just feel eco-friendly, it looks it too, in the best way possible. Who says eco-friendly design has to be boring? Jaime Carrillo/Futurism Green, But Powerful: In many cases, sustainable products usually mean that the specs will be lacking behind similarly priced laptops. But the 11th Gen Intel Core processors and Iris Xe Graphics 3 provide plenty of prospects for productivity, collaboration, and even gaming. A 15.6-inch screen FHD display shines bright with the best of them. Find out more about how we gauge sustainability. Optimized Audio: Acer TrueHarmony and Acer PurifiedVoice deliver some of the best sound experiences in modern laptops. Using a high-quality magnet producing a high magnetic flux, TrueHarmony provides rich, lifelike audio that you can practically feel with louder highs and deeper lows. Aspire Vero is also PurifiedVoice ready, so your laptop will respond to voice commands quickly and easily. Totally Upgradeable: Far too often, tech companies prohibit you from playing with the guts of your computers, especially when it comes to upgrading your specs. Acer Aspire Vero not only lets you boost up your specs, but it encourages you to with common standardized screws for easy access. Learn more about the best laptops. Using the Acer Aspire Vero If you close your eyes, it\u2019s difficult to tell you\u2019re using an eco-friendly computer. Windows 11 boots up just as quick as it does on my gaming laptop, if not a second or two quicker. If you open your eyes, it becomes abundantly clear that you\u2019re using an eco-friendly computer. This isn\u2019t a bad thing, there\u2019s an immediate charm from the base of the laptop proudly showing off its PCR bonafides with a stamp reading \u201cPost Consumer Recycled\u201d on the bottom right of the surface under the keyboard. A more subtle design choice are the \u201cR\u201d and \u201cE\u201d keys which face left, reinforcing Aspire Vero\u2019s aim to \u201crecycle, reduce, and reuse.\u201d The speckled pattern along the laptop\u2019s panels both looks and feels environmentally friendly. The surface has a tactile feel made up of tiny honeycomb columns, which is a world away from the matte and shiny finishes on other laptops. (Acer also offers a guide to recycling its laptops.) Use those specs to the fullest, or save on battery life with a simple click. Jaime Carrillo/Futurism The Acer Aspire Vero\u2019s powerful processor and graphics card enable it to do all you might want in a laptop at this price range: It\u2019s perfect for media creation, 4K streaming, and even some light hardcore gaming. Running in performance mode occasionally makes a loud fan kick in, and you can expect the battery to drain after a few hours depending on how many apps you have running at once. Similarly priced laptops won\u2019t struggle as much and may pack better specs, but it still remains a solid go-to workhorse, especially for a home office. Save more energy at home with the best solar panels. But what makes Acer Aspire Vero stand apart is the built-in VeroSense software, which lets you pick between four different performance modes to further extend battery life, efficiency, and even your overall carbon footprint. Better yet, it\u2019s easy to cycle between modes at will. Even the packaging is made from recycled materials, complete with a reusable cardboard stand. With Earth Day around the corner, it\u2019s easy to recommend one of the most sustainable laptops ever conceived, especially because it can revamp your tech the second it starts to feel dated.

            "content": "Building design teams face a range of challenges during the design phase, from building higher while avoiding higher costs to reducing the time to occupancy. If teams don\u2019t do their due diligence, they risk omitting from design documents important mechanical equipment, like exhaust fans and valves, for example, or failing to size electrical circuits appropriately for loads. Designing for sustainability adds even more complexity to the process, chiefly because it requires integrating \u201cgreen\u201d principles and complying with environmental laws and regulations. Stephane Levy, a construction industry veteran, is of the persuasion that technology can solve many of these issues. He\u2019s the founder of BeamUP, a startup emerging from stealth that uses data to cut down design times and manage a facility\u2019s systems over their lifecycle. BeamUP today announced that it raised $15 million in a seed funding round led by StageOne Ventures and Ibex Investments along with participation from angels including Workday CEO Chano Fernandez. \u201cConstruction and property management are among the last major industries to digitize. Even though there is widespread recognition that legacy processes are untenable, some people in the industry have an apprehension that new methods can carry even greater risk \u2026 [There are] many regional players and a multitude of stakeholders with different incentives,\u201d Levy, a graduate of Tel Aviv University with a bachelor\u2019s degree from the University of Pennsylvania, told TechCrunch via email. \u201cBeamUP [is the] first platform that is using AI to execute on facility design and management at scale to [meet] the unique requirements of Fortune 500 organizations.\u201d Applying AI to building design Large enterprises own and maintain a lot of buildings. According to a U.S. Census Bureau survey, the average company with over 10,000 employees has around 411, including data centers, corporate campuses, logistics centers and warehouses. These structures \u2014 many of which had special compliance and security needs to begin with \u2014 are becoming increasingly complex with the advent of building automation systems. They\u2019re also becoming huge carbon hogs, consuming roughly 40% of all energy used on the planet. Technology could, in theory, help simplify managing, designing and reducing the carbon footprint of corporate building portfolios. But the field of architecture is notoriously slow to adopt new processes. As a 2020 Wall Street Journal piece points out, while computer-aided software became the norm in the \u201970s and \u201980s, it wasn\u2019t until 2002 that 3D modeling arrived with Autodesk\u2019s purchase of building information modeling (BIM) software vendor Revit. Even then, it took nearly 20 years for BIM software \u2014 which enables architects to look at building cross-sections from any angle \u2014 to become the industry standard. A photo of the BeamUP team. Image Credits: BeamUP The slow uptake threatens to impede the industry\u2019s progress toward desired goals, like improved sustainability. A recent survey from the American Institute of Architects found that only 10% to 11% of architects have adopted building performance technologies like lifecycle assessment software, plug-ins or other measurement tools. Only one in three architects feel that they\u2019re meeting their responsibility to design sustainably as a result, the survey showed. \u201cNinety percent of spreadsheets contain errors. And yet enterprises with hundreds, if not thousands, of buildings are tracking critical information within them,\u201d Levy said. \u201cSeventy percent of rework during construction is a consequence of design mistakes [and re]work is expensive, representing 7.25% and 10.89% of total construction costs. Think about that wastage on a data center, for example, where construction costs can exceed $1 billion \u2026 By the time a building is ready for operations, 30% of [the] design data \u2026 is lost, so the documentation doesn\u2019t match the actual facility. [The] overall facility lifecycle is fragmented with multiple engineering firms [and] multiple single point tools that focus on just one part of the lifecycle \u2014 design, for example \u2014 with disparate file formats.\u201d BeamUP can uniquely address the challenge by creating a \u201cnetwork\u201d of an organization\u2019s buildings, Levy says, moving an enterprise beyond managing each of its facilities as a separate asset while driving \u201canalytical insights\u201d into performance and efficiency. The platform can ostensibly help to answer questions like \u201cWhich building types have the most compliance issues?\u201d and \u201cIs my equipment higher in one region compared to another?,\u201d as well as \u201cHow do I reduce my spend by only approving devices which demonstrate long lifespans and low failure rates?\u201d \u201cOur tech includes algorithms and deep learning models trained on a vast training set of thousands of building examples in order to automate the design process,\u201d Levy said. \u201c[We use a] unique data set of enterprise floor plans to train our systems \u2014 our training images number in the high hundreds of thousands. [As] part of our research efforts, we are using \u2026 databases of design and facility data to train AI models [that] predict design and compliance solutions.\u201d BeamUP\u2019s building portfolio dashboard for mobile. Image Credits: BeamUP The data that BeamUP works with spans facility asset model numbers, locations, wiring infrastructure and different architectural elements. While the platform collects some sensitive customer data, like email addresses and activity within the system, Levy says that users can request their data be deleted in accordance with the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation. Levy believes BeamUP\u2019s data-driven approach is a major hook for enterprises because it moves beyond rule-based design and compliance standards that can be challenging to document over time. The \u201cdigital-forward\u201d nature of BeamUP has also had more appeal during the pandemic, he says, at a time when designers\u2019 ability to fly around the world to inspect assets and assess regulatory compliance is constrained. \u201c[Our] tech provides a significantly deeper understanding of design standards, best practices, compliance conformity and understanding facility and asset performance at global scale,\u201d Levy said. \u201cThe changes in office layouts as well as the downsizing of corporate office real estate footprints [during the pandemic] all require re-design of building systems \u2014 e.g., shrinking from three floors to one still necessitates a significant amount of change that needs to be designed and managed.\u201d Competition in the market The urban planning and design software market that BeamUP occupies was worth an estimated $2.91 billion in 2021. Levy asserts that it doesn\u2019t have direct competition outside of existing BIM software, but he acknowledges that there are several proptech and construction tech companies applying analytics to different areas of the industry, like construction planning automation startup Swapp. Still, Levy says that BeamUP has had no trouble attracting customers, with five Fortune 100 companies engaged in pilots or under contract and more than 1,100 users on the platform. Data center and logistics construction have proven to be BeamUP\u2019s largest verticals to date, Levy added, perhaps because those facilities often have complex systems that need to be maintained over time. One hurdle for BeamUP \u2014 and others looking to compete with it \u2014 is likely to be maintaining growth. According to The Wall Street Journal piece, BIM adoption didn\u2019t climb until the recession in the late 2000s, when many laid-off and underemployed young architects used their free time to learn the software and firms adjusted to designing with fewer staff. Absent a comparable jolt to the industry, BeamUP will have to convince firms that investing in its technology will be worth their while in the long run. BeamUP provides a glimpse at building layouts. Image Credits: BeamUP Nate Meir, for one, a partner at StageOne Ventures, expressed confidence in BeamUP\u2019s trajectory. \u201cThe enormous scale and global footprint of large enterprises, which account for 60% of commercial real estate globally, not only affect their financial performance, but it also impacts economies, from energy consumption, through transportation planning, employee well-being, to job creation and much more,\u201d he told TechCrunch via email. \u201cAs we closely monitored their [BeamUP\u2019s progress], they demonstrated impressive traction with global customers who are automating these processes to improve operations and significantly cut costs, year over year.\u201d Levy says that the capital will be used to scale three-year-old, 37-employee BeamUP\u2019s marketing, sales and customer delivery teams spread across the U.S., the U.K. and Israel (where the company is based). BeamUP anticipates that it\u2019ll grow its workforce to 85 people by the end of the year as revenue rises an eye-popping 800% versus 2022. Despite the hype, construction tech will be hard to disrupt",

Station A is an online marketplace that connects building operators with businesses offering solar paneling, battery storage and electric vehicle charging. (Bloomberg) -- A San Francisco startup is looking to capitalize on the efforts by colleges, offices, and corporate campuses to reduce their carbon footprints. Station A is an online marketplace that connects building operators with businesses offering solar paneling, battery storage and electric vehicle charging. Part of a wave of technology companies offering services to ease the transition to net zero, the venture has given an \u201cenergy grade\u201d to more than 765,000 buildings in the U.S., representing over ten thousand square feet. The grade is based on a building\u2019s estimated long-term savings from efficiency upgrades. To make its calculations, Station A combines financial, satellite, utility and proprietary data. The startup plans to take a commission from deals cut on its marketplace, although it declined to share the terms. . Chief executive officer Kevin Berkemeyer says the startup is like a \u201cZillow of clean energy.\u201d And he argues that its central marketplace replaces the existing convoluted system for purchasing. \u201cWe\u2019re mainly competing with the status quo,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, the customer\u2019s interests are not well represented in the in the traditional process.\u201d In 2018, Station A spun out as a standalone company from NRG Energy Inc., the oil and gas firm that, like its peers, has invested into Silicon Valley as part of its promised shift to more renewable production. Berkemeyer said the Texas company, where he previously worked, is a shareholder in Station A. Commercial buildings account for over a third of U.S. electricity usage, according to the Department of Energy. Several states have established targets for buildings to cut carbon emissions in coming decades; California\u2019s plans calls for half of all commercial buildings to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030. Money has poured into energy suppliers and companies that offer building retrofits in the past decade. Now there\u2019s a smaller stream of investment into businesses providing resources for buyers planning to go green. Redaptive Inc., a company that installs lighting and air conditioning upgrades in commercial buildings, raised $157 million in 2020. Others, such as PassiveLogic and Extensible Energy, provide sensors and software to building owners to manage energy usage more efficiently. These companies are all searching for the \u201clowest-hanging fruit\u201d to convince businesses to spend more on cleaner tech, explained Jon Bonanno, a clean energy investor with Strategic Operating Partners. \u201cThat\u2019s the key to enormous decarbonization very quickly,\u201d he said. According to Berkemeyer, the Station A marketplace has identified more than $135 billion in potential savings in buildings listed on its service. The work can be financed with no money down. For others, the startup, which has raised $5 million since 2018, could lean on its investors like NRG, Southern Power and Schneider Electric SE, power companies equipped to provide installations. (Berkemeyer says these investors don\u2019t have any special treatment in the marketplace.) But simply giving a snapshot of the savings and green benefits of adding a solar roof or electrical heating might not be enough. Many mom-and-pop property owners are reluctant to make such upgrades that require complicated financing and risk, said Bonanno, the investor. \u201cThey\u2019re extremely conservative,\u201d he added. \u201cBeing able to show [them] the data is a good first step, but it\u2019s not the last stop.\u201d \u00a92022 Bloomberg L.P.",

            "full_description": "Amazon is expanding its suite of tech products aimed at kids with a brand new smart projector called the Amazon Glow . This device is designed to help children connect with family and friends through reading, drawing, and playing without having to be in the same physical space as each other. Rather than projecting onto a wall, the Glow shines down onto a touch-sensitive pad that reacts to input from whoever is using the device. Kids can read their favorite books from the Amazon Kids Plus service (the Glow comes with a one-year subscription), draw using virtual tools, and play games. Meanwhile, a family member can appear over video call (thanks to Glow\u2019s in-built screen) and interact with play space using the free Amazon Glow app on their smartphone or tablet. Parental controls ensure that only pre-approved contacts can connect to the Amazon Glow, and the camera and microphones can be shut off in an instant using the privacy shutter. If you want to try the Amazon Glow out for yourself, it\u2019s available in the US for $300. Amazon has yet to announce a release date for other territories, so we\u2019ve reached out to see if we can find out more (if we hear back we\u2019ll be sure to update this piece). We haven't had a chance to try the Amazon Glow out for ourselves yet, but reactions to the device online have been mostly positive so far from what we can see. There are reports that the device suffers from its fair share of glitches but kids seem to love the chance to play with their relatives, rather than just having to chat over a boring video call. Earlier this year, we wrote about how VR games had a similar effect on us when catching up with friends and family. Instead of having to put up with an impersonal video call, we all had a much more enjoyable time by chatting over a round of virtual golf together . VR isn't for everyone, and isn't really designed for kids right now. The Amazon Glow seems to capture a lot of the ideas that made our virtual interactions great and packages them in a much more kid-friendly device. We'll have to see if reactions to the Glow remain positive, though for those looking to travel less because of ongoing health concerns or a desire to reduce your carbon footprint - Amazon's latest gadget could be just what you're looking for.",

He is Chief Information Security Officer at NCHENG LLP. getty The cloud is a vast network of data centers that provide services to other companies and individuals. It's not just a place to store your documents but a place where you can access files, apps and sites from any device. Because cloud computing is accessible from anywhere, it offers a way to access on-demand data, applications or services. One of the main forms of cloud computing, for example, is the public cloud, and you're probably familiar with public clouds like Dropbox or Google Drive for storing files or as a backup option. But there are many other different facets to cloud computing and various purposes, such as: \u2022 Hosting websites. \u2022 Managing customer data. \u2022 Managing credit card transactions. \u2022 Providing instant messaging services. MORE FOR YOU Google Issues Warning For 2 Billion Chrome Users Forget The MacBook Pro, Apple Has Bigger Plans Google Discounts Pixel 6, Nest & Pixel Buds In Limited-Time Sale Event \u2022 Displaying online content. Other common uses of cloud computing include email applications, chatbots and social media platforms that have integrated cloud technologies into their software. This shift in technology has allowed businesses to save money on resources and reduce their carbon footprint. Cloud computing is primarily used for applications that require a lot of power and bandwidth. Because it makes things easier and is more cost-effective, many companies use the cloud when they have a smaller budget to provide their products or services. Key Questions When Selecting A Provider And Planning A Migration With the cloud, you don't have to worry about which server your website or application is being hosted on. This means you can focus on other important aspects, like content development and driving traffic. Another reason cloud computing is so popular is that it's easy to use. You don't need any special skills or equipment to start with major cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, among others. Still, there are various options available for cloud hosting, and it can be difficult to decide which one will best suit your business. Here are some important questions for assessing the pros and cons of each option so that you can find a perfect solution for your organization. \u2022 What kind of budget do you have? \u2022 Are your organization's needs better met by on-premise hosting or public clouds? \u2022 Do you need unlimited data storage/bandwidth/storage capacity? \u2022 What security features do vendors have? \u2022 How much control would you have over software features such as server upgrades (and other services)? You'll also need to evaluate the cloud economically to ensure you're not spending more than necessary. Generally, cloud services feature a \"pay-as-you-go\" plan, and you'll need to ask vendors about extra costs like hardware replacement when things break down. By being economical, you can ensure you're investing your resources in the platform itself. Once you've answered those key questions, you'll need to consider how to migrate. When doing so, you'll need to ask yourself these questions and, when necessary, work with your service provider to come up with answers. \u2022 What are your goals and objectives with incorporating cloud technology? \u2022 Do you want to migrate on-premises data to the cloud or move virtual machines between cloud providers? \u2022 Do you want to maintain existing server-side applications or build new applications from scratch? At this point, you'll need to factor in how much time and money you have to make the transition, as well as what kind of data you are migrating. To answer these questions, evaluate what kind of resources you will need for a seamless transition between your old setup and the new one. To answer these questions, you will want to consult cloud service providers and consider working cloud consultants or hiring in-house experts. Final Thoughts You also want to ask yourself how much time you can afford not having access to any services running on your current setup. Sometimes, businesses need 24/7 uptime. In those cases, businesses should consider using multiple cloud providers to ensure that they will have a seamless transition when one cloud is unavailable. You can also use cloud-bursting to migrate data back and forth between the two different cloud providers to ensure that your business always remains online. In any case, it's best to have a plan of attack before you make any decisions on how you're going to migrate your infrastructure over to the cloud. It might be tempting at first, but if you don't take the time to plan, then it could end up costing your business in the long run.

            "full_description": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s climate change plan is built around his theory that Canadians most likely to vote Liberal want him to set tough targets for reducing Canada\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions and then fail to meet them. George Monbiot, one of the world\u2019s leading environmental journalists, described what Trudeau is doing in the Canadian edition of his 2006 book Heat: How To Stop the Planet From Burning. He said in \u201crich\u201d countries of the world, like Canada, \u201cour response will be to demand that the government act, while hoping that it doesn\u2019t. We will wish our governments to pretend to act. We get the moral satisfaction of saying what we know to be right, without the discomfort of doing it. \u201cMy fear is that the political parties in most rich nations have already recognized this.\u201d The latest Liberal climate change plan released by Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault on Tuesday is a manifesto of pretending to act. The Trudeau government, which has presided over an increase of Canada\u2019s emissions by seven million tonnes annually from 2015 to 2019, now claims it can lower them by up to 324 million tonnes and by at least 287 million tonnes by 2030. Trudeau\u2019s minimum target would mean cutting emissions equivalent to Canada\u2019s entire oil and gas sector (191.4 million tonnes in 2019) and building sector (90.7 million tonnes) by 2030. His maximum target would mean cutting emissions equivalent to Canada\u2019s entire oil and gas sector (191.4 million tonnes), agriculture sector (72.7 million tonnes) and electricity sector (61.1 million tonnes). In Guibeault\u2019s plan released Tuesday, Trudeau claims Canada is on track so far to lower emissions by 36.4% by 2030 \u2014 slightly below his minimum target \u2014 by cutting 77% of emissions in the electricity sector; 43% in the \u201cwaste and others\u201d sector including coal production, light manufacturing, construction and forest resources; 42% in the oil and gas sector; 42% in the buildings sector; 32% in the heavy industry sector and 23% in the transportation sector. This is in a report that revealed, according to the government\u2019s own figures, that Trudeau failed to achieve his 2020 target of cutting emissions to 30% below 2005 levels by 61 million tonnes, consistent with nine consecutive failures to achieve emission cuts promised by federal Liberal and Conservative governments going back to 1988. Paying for these failures hasn\u2019t come cheap, with the Trudeau government boasting last year it has invested $100 billion fighting climate change since 2015. To help pay for all this, Trudeau imposed a carbon tax on four Canadian provinces with more than 50% of the country\u2019s population \u2014 Ontario, Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan \u2014 beginning in 2019 because, he said, their plans to lower emissions were insufficient to meet the federal standard. The federal government insists this tax leaves 80% of Canadian families who pay it better off financially through carbon tax rebates, a claim it continued to make while revealing its latest plan this week, even though Parliament\u2019s independent, non-partisan budgetary officer said last week that in reality, 60% of families are paying more in carbon taxes than they get in rebates, which will rise to 80% in Ontario by 2024 and in Alberta by 2028. In other words, in Canada more than half the country is paying a federal sin tax for using fossil fuel energy to maintain the fiction we are reducing emissions to levels we won\u2019t achieve, while the rest of the country is paying provincial sin taxes to do the same.",

            "full_description": "(Bloomberg) -- A trade group of major automakers is intervening in a court case about new greenhouse gas emissions rules from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency -- and this time they are siding with regulators. (Bloomberg) -- A trade group of major automakers is intervening in a court case about new greenhouse gas emissions rules from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency -- and this time they are siding with regulators. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents companies such as Ford Motor Co., General Motors Co., Stellantis NV, Honda Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp., said it was filing a motion with the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals in support of the EPA. The lawsuit seeks to invalidate the agency\u2019s greenhouse gas emission regulations that automakers achieve a vehicle mileage of 52 miles (83.7 kilometers) per gallon by 2026 across all models they make, up from 40 mpg this year. The lawsuit argues the EPA exceeded its authority and violated the U.S. Constitution\u2019s separation-of-powers principles in setting the stringent greenhouse gas emission rules. The case was filed in December by Texas, Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Utah. \u201cThe Alliance for Automotive Innovation intervened in this action because our members support maintaining EPA\u2019s final rule in its current form, and do not believe it should be vacated. Full Stop,\u201d John Bozzella, president and chief executive officer of the alliance, said in a statement. \u201cBut I won\u2019t sugarcoat it. The rule is challenging and aggressive.\u201d The intervention comes as the Biden administration is expected to finalize new fuel economy standards for cars that will be implemented by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration this week. Read More: Biden\u2019s Electric-Car Push Unites Feuding Fuel-Makers The U.S. Transportation Department, which oversees the safety administration said when it first proposed the new standards last year that they would increase fuel efficiency 8% annually for model years 2024 to 2026, and increase the estimated fleet-wide average by 12 miles per gallon by model year 2026. The agency faces a March 31 deadline to finalize new rules for the 2024 model year, and it hopes to sync its fuel economy standards with the EPA\u2019s greenhouse gas emission rules by 2026. For it\u2019s part, the EPA has said its proposal would result in a 10% reduction in vehicle emissions in model year 2023 and then a 5% greater emissions reduction improvement each year after through 2026. The agencies measure pollution differently, with the EPA focusing on tailpipe emissions and the NHTSA rules centering on miles-per-gallon. The new regulations are part of a Biden plan that calls for half of all vehicles sold in the U.S. to be capable of emissions-free driving by the end of the decade, an ambitious goal that automakers say can only be achieved with bigger government investment in charging stations and other infrastructure. Bozzella said the components of the EPA\u2019s rule that help with the auto industry\u2019s transition to electric vehicles such as the ability to purchase credits from automakers like Tesla Inc. that sell large amounts of electric cars should be left in place as well. \u201cThe country needs a range of supportive policies and other tools in place to accelerate the shift to electric vehicles and to enhance American competitiveness including the regulatory components in this rule like EV multipliers and zero upstream emissions,\u201d Bozzella said. \u00a92022 Bloomberg L.P.",

            "full_description": "Increasing aluminum can recycling rate to 90% would generate $6.6B for the U.S. economy, add more than 100,000 jobs, keep 1.3M tons of aluminum out of landfills and reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions by 12.1M metric tons of CO2e WESTMINSTER, Colo. and ANN ARBOR, Mich. , March 30, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, Ball Corporation (NYSE: BLL ) and Resource Recycling Systems (RRS), a sustainable material and resource consulting firm, released a new nationwide study showing the economic and environmental benefits of improving the aluminum can recycling rate in the United States to 90% \u2013 an increase from the current rate of 38%. Infinitely recyclable and economically valuable, aluminum is among the most sustainable beverage packaging materials, and when recycled, uses 92% less energy than virgin material and supports increased supply of domestic recycled metal. In 2021, Ball Corporation released its vision for increased circularity across the industry in the Towards a Perfect Circle Report ( 2021). The report details a vision for the industry to achieve a 90% global recycling rate of aluminum. The new study from RRS and Ball Corporation demonstrates the environmental and economic impact of achieving this goal in the U.S. The new study entitled \"Recycling Aluminum Cans Is Good Business\" indicates that a substantial improvement of the U.S. aluminum recycling rate would provide the following benefits: Contribute 103,800 jobs in collection, sorting, and reprocessing to the U.S. economy; More than double total waste collection and recycling industry wages from $2.1 billion to $5 billion ; Generate $1.6 billion in economic activity through material sales; Keep 1.3 million tons of materials out of landfills each year; Save enough energy to power 1.5 million homes for a year; and Reduce GHG emissions by 12.1 million MTCO2e annually \u2013 equivalent to taking 2.6 million cars off the road for a year. \"There is no question the market for more recycled aluminum is there, and so is the potential for huge energy savings and job creation,\" said John Hayes , chairman of Ball Corporation. \"That's why we're advocating for smart recycling policies at the state and federal level that can help the U.S. reduce our dependence on imported materials, strengthen our domestic supply chain and make these benefits a reality.\" \"The benefits of increasing aluminum recycling rates in this country are very clear,\" said Marisa Adler , Senior Consultant, RRS. \"Now it's up to leaders at the state and federal level to develop a policy roadmap for making the most of this opportunity.\" The \"Recycling Aluminum Cans Is Good Business\" analysis, was compiled using 2021 data sourced from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Aluminum Association and Ball Corporation. The analysis also demonstrates how improved recycling enhances our nation's domestic supply chain of aluminum and decreases our reliance on primary aluminum imports. The study includes factsheets and data for all 50 states, in addition to a national snapshot. RRS used state recycling rate data from the 50 States of Recycling Report (2021) to determine baselines. Notably, while the Aluminum Association has reported a 45.2% consumer recycling rate for aluminum cans, the RRS analysis uses 38% as the national baseline to reflect the percentage of aluminum that actually makes it to remelting facilities, after material losses that occur during collection and sorting. Unfortunately, collection and recycling are not synonymous. As detailed in Ball Corporation's Towards a Perfect Circle Report (2021), boosting collection rates exponentially increases the amount of recycled material that is kept in the loop over the long term.

Hong)A growing number of governments and companies are adopting net-zero greenhouse gas emissions targets. These targets often evoke nature as a way to store or remove carbon from the atmosphere to counter the climate effect of other emissions. For example, in 2019, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised Greta Thunberg that Canada would plant two billion trees by 2030, and investing in nature is now a key part of Canada\u2019s climate strategy. Forests, peat bogs, wetlands and other ecosystems remove carbon from the atmosphere via photosynthesis and store it in leaves, trunks and roots, and in the soil. But carbon storage in nature is likely temporary because it can be lost again due to either human activities or natural disturbances. In contrast, the climate effect of carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels is effectively permanent. If these efforts to increase natural carbon stocks are short-lived, is there any climate benefit? Our new research suggests that temporary nature-based carbon storage can help achieve our climate goals. However, the most tangible effect \u2014 a decrease in peak warming \u2014 would only occur if we also eliminate fossil fuel emissions. Nature-based climate solutions Nature-based climate solutions are actions that seek to reduce the amount of carbon in the atmosphere by increasing carbon storage in natural systems. Examples include reforestation, nature conservation and improved agricultural practices. They can contribute to climate mitigation by preventing emissions from human land-use activities, or by maintaining and enhancing natural processes that remove carbon from the atmosphere. Read more: How investing in green infrastructure can jump-start the post-coronavirus economy But the carbon stored in nature is unlikely to be permanently removed from the atmosphere. Disturbances like wildfire would cause carbon to be lost back to the atmosphere. Conflicting human land-use priorities can also cause previously protected natural areas to be threatened by industrial activities. If nature-based carbon storage is temporary, then its climate benefit would also be short-lived. We need to think about nature-based climate solutions in relation to other climate mitigation efforts to understand their true benefits. What if nature-based carbon storage is temporary? Carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels have climate effects that persist for centuries. In contrast, nature-based carbon removal will only have a climate effect for as long as the carbon remains stored. In our study, we set out to explore what temporary removal would mean for future climate. We used a climate model to simulate the climate response to temporary removal alongside two different future emissions scenarios. If emissions continue to increase until 2040, followed by gradual decline, global temperatures would rise throughout the century. In this scenario, nature-based carbon removal would only delay the occurrence of a particular warming level. In our highest removal scenario, sequestering a quarter of current annual emissions every year until 2050 only delays the time we reach 1.5 C by a year, and 2 C by eight years. Climate effect of temporary nature-based carbon removal. (Authors) However, if future emissions are decreased rapidly to net-zero by mid-century and then remain net-negative, global temperatures would peak around 1.6 C and then decline during the second half of the century. Here, temporary nature-based carbon removal would decrease the temperature peak by as much as a tenth of a degree. This might seem small, but it is an important and tangible climate benefit that will only occur if the world also succeeds in eliminating fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions over the coming decades. How should we think about nature-based climate solutions? Our results challenge the way nature-based climate solutions are discussed as a climate policy option. Nature-based solutions are often presented as one of many different ways that we could mitigate our impact on climate, and are seen as interchangeable with other climate actions. Alternately, nature-based solutions are used as offsets, explicitly held up as a substitute for other emissions reductions. Both of these framings are problematic. If nature-based carbon storage is temporary, then its climate effect is not equivalent to avoiding fossil fuel carbon dioxide emission. This means that treating nature-based carbon storage as an alternative to other emissions reductions will, at best, delay crossing temperature thresholds. At worst, this could lead to more emissions and long-term warming. Electric vehicles charge at street stations in Norway. (Shutterstock) On the other hand, if we take action to increase natural carbon storage in addition to ambitious emissions reductions, it could contribute to limiting peak warming. Even temporary nature-based carbon storage could have an important climate benefit. The case for better nature conservation and stewardship Our results reveal some of the risks of relying on nature-based climate solutions at the expense of other climate mitigation efforts. However, nature conservation and better stewardship of natural areas can also lead to other positive environmental outcomes. These environmental co-benefits, such as increased biodiversity and improved water and air quality, are also vital to climate resilience. Wetlands, including those that have been damaged and destroyed by peat mining, can be restored to improve carbon storage if managed properly. (Shutterstock) If done in partnership with Indigenous and other local communities, nature-based solutions could also have positive social co-benefits such as supporting livelihoods and cultural values. Taking a holistic view of nature-based climate solutions would help to realize these multiple benefits. It is critical that nature-based climate solutions are not presented as an alternative to other climate mitigation options. As a complementary action however, they could play an important role in meeting both climate and other sustainability goals. H.

            "content": "The European Union has announced a new bundle of sustainability-focused policy proposals that will expand existing ecodesign rules on energy efficiency by encouraging longer product lifespans, supporting the growth of circular economy business models and helping consumers combat greenwashing and make more environmentally friendly purchasing choices, as regional lawmakers work to make good on a Circular Economy Action Plan announced two years ago. The bloc\u2019s overarching European Green Deal plan has the stated goal of making the region \u201cclimate neutral\u201d by 2050. That mission translates to no net emissions of greenhouse gases within a timeframe of (now) just under three decades while decoupling the EU\u2019s economic growth from resource use \u2014 aka a shift to a circular economy where products are designed to last longer and also to be easy to disassemble for reuse or recycling at end of life. So there is, very clearly, lots of work for policymakers to do. Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine has only added to the urgency of the EU\u2019s climate mission \u2014 underscoring the case for the bloc to rapidly move away from using fossil fuels for energy and wider economic fuel as many Member States remain heavily reliant on oil and gas from Russia, leaving their economies exposed to the ongoing regional instability. In a press release announcing its latest sustainability policy package, the Commission suggests that, by 2030, the revised ecodesign framework could lead to 132 mtoe [million tonnes of oil equivalent] of primary energy savings \u2014 which it emphasizes is \u201calmost equivalent to EU\u2019s import of Russian gas\u201d (which corresponds to \u201croughly to 150 bcm [billion cubic meters] of natural gas\u201d). It is also keen to flag the value of existing EU ecodesign requirements (which are focused on energy efficiency) \u2014 saying they saved consumers \u20ac120BN and led to a 10% lower annual energy consumption by the products in scope. The latest proposals to slot under the EU\u2019s \u2018green deal\u2019 umbrella include an interesting idea for Digital Product Passports (see below) \u2014 which is part of a wider push to increase product sustainability via a Regulation on Ecodesign for Sustainable Products (aka ESPR). The latter sets new requirements to \u201cmake products more durable, reliable, reusable, upgradable, reparable, easier to maintain, refurbish and recycle, and energy and resource efficient\u201d; and looks set to apply across the board from products such as metals and textiles all the way up to mobile phones and tablets. \u201cThe objective of the Commission\u2019s Ecodesign proposal is to make sustainable products the norm on the EU market and reduce their overall environmental and climate impacts,\u201d the EU\u2019s executive writes, adding: \u201cThe \u2018take-make-use-dispose\u2019 model can be avoided, and much of a product\u2019s environmental impacts is determined at the design stage.\u201d The ecodesign proposal extends existing EU rules in this area to both broaden the scope of products covered by ecodesign regulations (the Commission says it wants almost all products to fall in scope in the future) and to broaden requirements on those products to encompass circularity and an overall reduction of products\u2019 environmental and climate footprint, in addition to energy efficiency criteria. So it\u2019s fair to say that the bloc\u2019s concept of \u2018ecodesign\u2019 is being radically redesigned \u2014 and, well, upgraded. The Commission argues that this broader ecodesign strategy will lead to more energy and resource independence and less pollution, and also anticipates it creating \u201ceconomic opportunities for innovation and job creation\u201d, especially in areas such as remanufacturing, maintenance, recycling and repair. So hot European startups of the future could be in areas like smarter waste management and upcycling. Specific per product requirements aren\u2019t clear, as yet, as the EU\u2019s approach starts with a big picture proposal for a framework and a process \u2014 via which the Commission (\u201cworking in close cooperation with all those concerned\u201d) will gradually set out requirements for each product or group of products, yielding specific stipulations down the line. Its approach also suggests there could end up being a degree of variability in requirements across different types of products, as various trade offs (perhaps product longevity vs energy efficiency of manufacture, say) are weighed up and variously assessed in each specific product context. (Variation may also creep in as a result of sector-specific lobbying ofc.) \u201cThese ecodesign requirements will be tailored to the particular characteristics of the product groups concerned,\u201d the Commission writes in a communication on the proposal. \u201cTheir identification and development will factor-in the potential for improvement and relative effectiveness in delivering increased resource and energy efficiency, enabling longer product life and maximising the value embedded in materials, reducing pollution and the overall impact of products on climate and the environment.\u201d In a list of sample ecodesign requirements which may apply to different types of products, the communication offers examples that include mandates to minimize waste (such as packaging waste); set a minimum level of recycled content that a product must contain; and require ease of disassembly, remanufacturing and recycling of products and materials, among others. \u201cOnly a few sectors, such as food, feed, and medicinal products, are exempted,\u201d the EU further specifies in a Q&A on the sustainable products initiative which also states that incoming ecodesign and labelling rules will cover product groups which are not regulated now, such as smartphones, tablets and photovoltaic solar systems. So gadgets look set to fall squarely in scope, along with almost every other type of non-edible thing and/or material used to make things which may be picked up off a shelf by or dropshipped to an EU consumer in the future (not to mention the packaging itself). Commenting in a statement, VirginijusSinkevi\u010dius, the EU commissioner for the environment, oceans and fisheries, said: \u201cOur circular economy proposals kick off an era where products will be designed in a way that brings benefits to all, respects the boundaries of our planet and protects the environment. Giving a longer lifespan to the phones we use, to the clothes we wear and to many other products will save money for European consumers. And at the end of their life products will not be a source of pollution but of new materials for the economy, decreasing the dependency of European businesses on imports.\u201d The Commission will launch a public consultation on the categories of products to be selected under the first ESPR working plan by the end of this year \u2014 but it suggests the first focus will be on product categories such as textiles, furniture, mattresses, tyres, detergents, paints, lubricants, and on intermediate products like iron, steel and aluminium, as it says these have \u201chigh environmental impact and potential for improvement\u201d. As the bloc expands ecodesign rules, repairability in general looks set to get a massive boost \u2014 again also for electronics, an area where the Commission already said (March 2020) it would be expanding requirements. \u201cWork has advanced significantly with assessing the feasibility of ecodesign requirements and an energy labelling scheme for mobile phones and tablets,\u201d it notes in a communication on its Ecodesign and Energy Labelling Working Plan, adopted today as a transitory measure \u201cto cover new energy-related products, update and increase the ambition for products that are already regulated\u201d until the expanded ecodesign regulation enters into force. \u201cThe requirements would be affecting energy efficiency as well as material efficiency (durability, reparability, upgradability and recycling) aspects. The regulations are expected to be adopted before the end of 2022,\u201d it goes on, adding: \u201cLikewise, work is well advanced to assess the feasibility of ecodesign requirements and energy labelling for solar photovoltaic modules, inverters and systems, including possible requirements on carbon footprint.\u201d Expanded EU ecodesign rules will apply equally to all products placed on the market, regardless of country of manufacture or importation, meaning gizmos made in Asia or the US that are intended for sale within the bloc won\u2019t be able to escape compliance with the sustainability requirements. European lawmakers propose a \u2018right to repair\u2019 for mobiles and laptops A Digital Product Passport for every thing Another part of the EU\u2019s plan for revised ecodesign rules includes a proposal to introduce Digital Product Passports to store key data to improve traceability around products and support repair/recycling etc by standardizing the information which product manufacturers must provide. The Commission also intends these passports to arm consumers with information on environmental impacts to inform purchasing decisions. This could include energy consumption info but also \u2014 via new EU Energy Labels for relevant products \u2014 a repairability score. \u201c[P]roduct-specific information requirements will ensure consumers know the environmental impacts of their purchases,\u201d the Commission suggests of the Digital Product Passport plan. \u201cAll regulated products will have Digital Product Passports. This will make it easier to repair or recycle products and facilitate tracking substances of concern along the supply chain. Labelling can be introduced as well.\u201d Digital product passports will be \u201cthe norm\u201d for all products regulated under the ESPR, per the Commission \u2014 with the goal to ensure that products are \u201ctagged, identified and linked to data relevant to their circularity and sustainability\u201d. \u201cThis proposal will\u2026 enable information requirements to be set for products to know more about the impacts of the products on our shelves and make more sustainable choices along the whole value chain,\u201d it adds. How exactly this will work isn\u2019t clear but presumably something like a QR code could be fixed to each product for scanning to view the associated sustainability data. \u201cDigital Product Passports will be rolled out for all regulated products,\u201d the Commission writes. \u201cThe product information can also take the form of \u2018classes of performance\u2019 \u2014 for instance ranging from \u2018A to G\u2019 \u2014 to facilitate comparison between products, possibly displayed in the form of a label. This would work in a manner similar to how the widely recognized EU Energy Label currently works, and be for instance used for a repairability score.\u201d The EU is also eyeing the potential for this standardized \u2018metadata\u2019 system to create other data-sharing opportunities \u2014 which could even lead to other types of business opportunity, or support additional pieces of sustainability legislation across the bloc. \u201cPioneering this approach for environmental sustainability data can also pave the way for wider voluntary data sharing, going beyond the products and requirements regulated under the ESPR,\u201d the Commission suggests. \u201cMoreover, product passports may be used for information on other sustainability aspects applicable to the relevant product group pursuant to other Union legislation.\u201d \u201cStructuring information on the environmental sustainability of products and transmitting it by means of digital product passports will help businesses along the value chain, from manufacturers, importers and distributors to dealers, repairers, remanufacturers and recyclers, to access information that is valuable in their work to improve environmental performance, prolong product lifetime, boost efficiency and the use of secondary raw materials, thus lowering the need for primary natural resources, saving costs and reducing strategic dependencies,\u201d it also argues. \u201cThis will also help track the presence of substances of concern throughout the life cycle of materials and products, following through on commitments made in the Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability and contributing to the EU\u2019s aim to achieve zero pollution. Digital product passports can also enable consumers to make more informed choices, improve transparency for public interest organisations and help national authorities in their enforcement and surveillance work.\u201d Other measures in the EU\u2019s ecodesign expansion proposal seek to end the destruction of unsold consumer goods \u2014 a practice that can be disturbingly widespread in ecommerce (hi Amazon!) and fashion, for example \u2014 through \u201cfar-reaching transparency requirements for those choosing to discard unsold goods, and the possibility to ban their destruction for relevant product groups\u201d. \u201c[L]arge businesses that discard unsold products will have to disclose their number per year, the reasons for the discarding and information on the amount of discarded products that they have delivered for preparing for re-use, remanufacturing, recycling, energy recovery and disposal operations in line with the waste hierarchy. They will have to ensure this information is made available, either on a freely accessible website, or via other means,\u201d the Commission writes. \u201cThis measure will apply to all concerned economic operators as soon as the regulation enters into force. The proposal explicitly prohibits circumvention techniques, such as a big company selling to small companies (which are normally exempted) to make them destroy products.\u201d Green public procurement will also be supported through mandatory criteria in the regulation. In addition, the Commission has presented two targeted sectoral initiatives today \u2014 one focused on sustainability and circularity of textiles, with the strategy there intended to make textiles \u201cmore durable, repairable, reusable and recyclable, to tackle fast fashion, textile waste and the destruction of unsold textiles, and ensure their production takes place in full respect of social rights\u201d by 2030; and another that aims to boost the internal market for construction products while also ensuring that the regulatory framework is geared towards sustainability and climate objectives. Both sectors have high carbon footprints. Sourceful grabs $20M to make more packaging less polluting EU lawmakers agree data reuse rules to foster AI and R&D",

            "full_description": "The European Union has announced a new bundle of sustainability-focused policy proposals that will expand existing ecodesign rules on energy efficiency by encouraging longer product lifespans, supporting the growth of circular economy business models and helping consumers combat greenwashing and make more environmentally friendly purchasing choices, as regional lawmakers work to make good on a Circular Economy Action Plan announced two years ago. The bloc\u2019s overarching European Green Deal plan has the stated goal of making the region \u201cclimate neutral\u201d by 2050. That mission translates to no net emissions of greenhouse gases within a timeframe of (now) just under three decades while decoupling the EU\u2019s economic growth from resource use \u2014 aka a shift to a circular economy where products are designed to last longer and also to be easy to disassemble for reuse or recycling at end of life. So there is, very clearly, lots of work for policymakers to do. Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine has only added to the urgency of the EU\u2019s climate mission \u2014 underscoring the case for the bloc to rapidly move away from using fossil fuels for energy and wider economic fuel as many Member States remain heavily reliant on oil and gas from Russia, leaving their economies exposed to the ongoing regional instability. In a press release announcing its latest sustainability policy package, the Commission suggests that, by 2030, the revised ecodesign framework could lead to 132 mtoe [million tonnes of oil equivalent] of primary energy savings \u2014 which it emphasizes is \u201calmost equivalent to EU\u2019s import of Russian gas\u201d (which corresponds to \u201croughly to 150 bcm [billion cubic meters] of natural gas\u201d). It is also keen to flag the value of existing EU ecodesign requirements (which are focused on energy efficiency) \u2014 saying they saved consumers \u20ac120BN and led to a 10% lower annual energy consumption by the products in scope. The latest proposals to slot under the EU\u2019s \u2018green deal\u2019 umbrella include an interesting idea for Digital Product Passports (see below) \u2014 which is part of a wider push to increase product sustainability via a Regulation on Ecodesign for Sustainable Products (aka ESPR) . The latter sets new requirements to \u201cmake products more durable, reliable, reusable, upgradable, reparable, easier to maintain, refurbish and recycle , and energy and resource efficient\u201d; and looks set to apply across the board from products such as metals and textiles all the way up to mobile phones and tablets. \u201cThe objective of the Commission\u2019s Ecodesign proposal is to make sustainable products the norm on the EU market and reduce their overall environmental and climate impacts,\u201d the EU\u2019s executive writes, adding: \u201cThe \u2018take-make-use-dispose\u2019 model can be avoided, and much of a product\u2019s environmental impacts is determined at the design stage.\u201d The ecodesign proposal extends existing EU rules in this area to both broaden the scope of products covered by ecodesign regulations (the Commission says it wants almost all products to fall in scope in the future) and to broaden requirements on those products to encompass circularity and an overall reduction of products\u2019 environmental and climate footprint, in addition to energy efficiency criteria. So it\u2019s fair to say that the bloc\u2019s concept of \u2018ecodesign\u2019 is being radically redesigned \u2014 and, well, upgraded. The Commission argues that this broader ecodesign strategy will lead to more energy and resource independence and less pollution, and also anticipates it creating \u201ceconomic opportunities for innovation and job creation\u201d, especially in areas such as remanufacturing, maintenance, recycling and repair. So hot European startups of the future could be in areas like smarter waste management and upcycling. Specific per product requirements aren\u2019t clear, as yet, as the EU\u2019s approach starts with a big picture proposal for a framework and a process \u2014 via which the Commission (\u201cworking in close cooperation with all those concerned\u201d) will gradually set out requirements for each product or group of products, yielding specific stipulations down the line. Its approach also suggests there could end up being a degree of variability in requirements across different types of products, as various trade offs (perhaps product longevity vs energy efficiency of manufacture, say) are weighed up and variously assessed in each specific product context. (Variation may also creep in as a result of sector-specific lobbying ofc.) \u201cThese ecodesign requirements will be tailored to the particular characteristics of the product groups concerned,\u201d the Commission writes in a communication on the proposal. \u201cTheir identification and development will factor-in the potential for improvement and relative effectiveness in delivering increased resource and energy efficiency, enabling longer product life and maximising the value embedded in materials, reducing pollution and the overall impact of products on climate and the environment.\u201d In a list of sample ecodesign requirements which may apply to different types of products, the communication offers examples that include mandates to minimize waste (such as packaging waste); set a minimum level of recycled content that a product must contain; and require ease of disassembly, remanufacturing and recycling of products and materials, among others. \u201cOnly a few sectors, such as food, feed, and medicinal products, are exempted,\u201d the EU further specifies in a Q&A on the sustainable products initiative which also states that incoming ecodesign and labelling rules will cover product groups which are not regulated now, such as smartphones, tablets and photovoltaic solar systems. So gadgets look set to fall squarely in scope, along with almost every other type of non-edible thing and/or material used to make things which may be picked up off a shelf by or dropshipped to an EU consumer in the future (not to mention the packaging itself). Commenting in a statement, VirginijusSinkevi\u010dius, the EU commissioner for the environment, oceans and fisheries, said: \u201cOur circular economy proposals kick off an era where products will be designed in a way that brings benefits to all, respects the boundaries of our planet and protects the environment. Giving a longer lifespan to the phones we use, to the clothes we wear and to many other products will save money for European consumers. And at the end of their life products will not be a source of pollution but of new materials for the economy, decreasing the dependency of European businesses on imports.\u201d The Commission will launch a public consultation on the categories of products to be selected under the first ESPR working plan by the end of this year \u2014 but it suggests the first focus will be on product categories such as textiles, furniture, mattresses, tyres, detergents, paints, lubricants, and on intermediate products like iron, steel and aluminium, as it says these have \u201chigh environmental impact and potential for improvement\u201d. As the bloc expands ecodesign rules, repairability in general looks set to get a massive boost \u2014 again also for electronics, an area where the Commission already said ( March 2020 ) it would be expanding requirements. \u201c Work has advanced significantly with assessing the feasibility of ecodesign requirements and an energy labelling scheme for mobile phones and tablets,\u201d it notes in a communication on its Ecodesign and Energy Labelling Working Plan, adopted today as a transitory measure \u201cto cover new energy-related products, update and increase the ambition for products that are already regulated\u201d until the expanded ecodesign regulation enters into force. \u201cThe requirements would be affecting energy efficiency as well as material efficiency (durability, reparability, upgradability and recycling) aspects. The regulations are expected to be adopted before the end of 2022,\u201d it goes on, adding: \u201c Likewise, work is well advanced to assess the feasibility of ecodesign requirements and energy labelling for solar photovoltaic modules, inverters and systems, including possible requirements on carbon footprint.\u201d Expanded EU ecodesign rules will apply equally to all products placed on the market, regardless of country of manufacture or importation, meaning gizmos made in Asia or the US that are intended for sale within the bloc won\u2019t be able to escape compliance with the sustainability requirements. European lawmakers propose a \u2018right to repair\u2019 for mobiles and laptops Another part of the EU\u2019s plan for revised ecodesign rules includes a proposal to introduce Digital Product Passports to store key data to improve traceability around products and support repair/recycling etc by standardizing the information which product manufacturers must provide. The Commission also intends these passports to arm consumers with information on environmental impacts to inform purchasing decisions. This could include energy consumption info but also \u2014 via new EU Energy Labels for relevant products \u2014 a repairability score. \u201c[P]roduct-specific information requirements will ensure consumers know the environmental impacts of their purchases,\u201d the Commission suggests of the Digital Product Passport plan. \u201cAll regulated products will have Digital Product Passports. This will make it easier to repair or recycle products and facilitate tracking substances of concern along the supply chain. Labelling can be introduced as well.\u201d Digital product passports will be \u201cthe norm\u201d for all products regulated under the ESPR, per the Commission \u2014 with the goal to ensure that products are \u201ctagged, identified and linked to data relevant to their circularity and sustainability\u201d. \u201cThis proposal will\u2026 enable information requirements to be set for products to know more about the impacts of the products on our shelves and make more sustainable choices along the whole value chain,\u201d it adds. How exactly this will work isn\u2019t clear but presumably something like a QR code could be fixed to each product for scanning to view the associated sustainability data. \u201cDigital Product Passports will be rolled out for all regulated products,\u201d the Commission writes. \u201cThe product information can also take the form of \u2018classes of performance\u2019 \u2014 for instance ranging from \u2018A to G\u2019 \u2014 to facilitate comparison between products, possibly displayed in the form of a label.

The World Meteorological Organization says greenhouse gas concentrations hit a new record high last year and continued to increase at a faster clip than the average rate in the last decadeLaurent Cipriani, Associated Press Utah technology executives know firsthand the transformative potential that innovation has in every aspect of life. And we know how the market works to reward and advance the best new products and technology.Thoughtful human invention makes our lives better, our world cleaner, our society stronger. Such innovation is already bringing a clean-energy, low-carbon future closer and closer.\u00a0Electric cars, for example, are cleaner and more efficient. Wind and solar have become less expensive power sources. Battery technology is advancing quickly. And next-generation nuclear and geothermal power are promising new possibilities. These are powerful trends from which Utah is already benefiting.Utahns can either embrace these energy technologies or be left behind.As technology leaders, we cannot ignore the innovative changes happening worldwide to make power cleaner. If we do, critical decisions and investments will happen elsewhere.Utah must lead out. We want these new technologies developed and deployed here. Our employees want to work at climate-conscious companies. They want to be a part of reducing air pollution here and, yes, around the world.Washington politicians and bureaucrats are now debating the best way to accelerate the progress on reducing emissions. But too much discussion centers on regulation and spending, ignoring the most critical need: government support for the innovation needed to clean and protect our environment.The good news is that is beginning to change.A new Conservative Climate Caucus, led by Utah Congressman John Curtis and joined by his fellow Utah colleagues Chris Stewart, Blake Moore and Burgess Owens, is a welcome step forward. They see the need for the next phase of innovation on clean energy and want to find responsible ways to encourage it.We don\u2019t need more regulations burdening and holding back the economy. We don\u2019t need government picking and choosing the winning technologies. What we need are clear and powerful incentives to develop new and better energy technologies to compete in the global market.Developing energy technologies generally requires a long-term investment from businesses and investors who need predictability and stable support for climate and environmental innovation, or those investments won\u2019t happen and those innovations won\u2019t occur.We believe strongly that capitalism and our markets \u2014 if allowed to operate without burdensome regulation \u2014 will find the best solutions.Today, there is no cost to use our air as a dumping ground for the byproducts of inefficient energy use. Polluters don\u2019t pay for it the way we do for our sewers, trash and almost every other byproduct of human life. In effect, today\u2019s policies subsidize and encourage pollution. That strikes us as working\u00a0against, rather than\u00a0for, innovation that can reduce emissions and clean the air.If policymakers incentivize the market to give us clean air and zero-carbon energy, then the market will deliver. And it will do it at scale.One possible option to reduce emissions is a carbon dividend approach. Here\u2019s how it works: Fossil fuel companies would be charged a fee for their emissions.\u00a0All\u00a0the money from those fees would be returned to the American people in the form of dividend checks. Those responsible for lower emissions would come out ahead.What about foreign polluters? Under a carbon dividend approach, a border adjustmentwould hold other countries accountable for their emissions, so businesses in Utah and across the United States can compete on a level playing field. Other countries \u2014 at least those wanting to sell products or do business in the U.S. \u2014 would no longer be allowed to pollute for free.Regardless of the approach, what is needed is a simple, transparent and effective way to unleash the full power of American ingenuity toward a low-carbon future. Whether it\u2019s small businesses, large corporations, utilities or individual households, a market-based approach will incentivize everyone to reduce emissions, or switch to newer, cleaner and more cost-effective technologies. It will be in their self-interest to do so.As technology executives, we value solutions that acknowledge technical progress, encourage innovation and let businesses compete in the market for the best solutions. Our country was built on market principles that allow invention and innovation to flourish.Now is the time for our representatives in Washington to act to encourage businesses to bring about a clean energy transition.David Bywater is CEO of Vivint; Adam Edmunds is CEO of Entrata; Jonathan Johnson is CEO of Overstock; Sam Malouf is CEO of Malouf; Jeff Pedersen is CEO of Cariloha; Davis Smith is CEO of Cotopaxi; and Ryan Westwood is CEO of Simplus.",

            "full_description": "Company aims for 20-percent customer emissions reduction by 2030 JACKSON, Mich. , March 30, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- CMS Energy and its primary business, Consumers Energy, today pledged to protect the planet by achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions from the company's entire natural gas production and delivery system \u2014 including customers and suppliers \u2014 by 2050. Achieving net zero emissions means eliminating the impact of emissions traced to the burning of natural gas by customers and greenhouse gas emissions caused by natural gas suppliers who produce and transport natural gas to Consumers Energy's system. \"Natural gas is safe and affordable and now it can be even more clean,\" President and CEO Garrick Rochow said. \"We're making historic, industry-leading changes to protect our planet. This commitment is another step in leading the clean energy transformation for Michigan .\" As a next step on our path to net zero by 2050, the company will partner with customers to reduce their emissions by 20 percent by 2030. CMS Energy is already implementing industry-leading plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These include: Modernizing its natural gas system to achieve net zero methane emissions from its operations by 2030. Ending coal use and boosting renewable energy fuel sources to achieve net zero carbon emissions from its electric operations by 2040. Pledging to power 1 million electric vehicles in the communities it serves by 2030. Pursuing a net zero goal for all emission sources, including those from customers and suppliers, aligns the company's efforts with Michigan's Healthy Climate Plan to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 as well as the recommendations of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming. CMS Energy is executing and exploring a variety of pathways to support customers and suppliers who want to reduce their emissions. Carbon offsets: The company recently received regulatory approval for a new program for residential and business customers who want to voluntarily offset carbon emissions from their natural gas use by investing in projects that help Michigan forests reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Renewable natural gas, or RNG: Produced from organic wastes and other renewable sources, RNG is interchangeable with conventional natural gas and a key technology available to reduce methane emissions. The company recently announced an agreement with Swisslane Farms in west Michigan to build a biodigester facility that, with regulatory approval, will convert agricultural waste into RNG. Energy efficiency: Providing customers with the power to reduce energy waste and lower bills through a variety of energy efficiency and demand response programs. Since 2009, we've helped customers save about $4 billion and prevented the emission of almost 19 million tons of carbon dioxide. Emerging technologies: Potential solutions include using hydrogen to produce energy, capturing and permanently storing carbon emissions from natural gas combustion and using hybrid natural gas and electric heat pump systems to heat homes and businesses. The company is also modernizing its natural gas operations with a 10-year Natural Gas Delivery Plan to ensure the continued delivery of safe, reliable, affordable and clean natural gas. The plan includes accelerated infrastructure replacement, innovative leak detection and key process changes to eliminate, avoid and minimize methane emissions. CMS Energy (NYSE: CMS ) is a Michigan -based company that has an electric and natural gas utility, Consumers Energy, as its primary business. It also owns and operates independent power generation businesses. Consumers Energy, Michigan's largest energy provider, provides natural gas and/or electricity to 6.8 million of the state's 10 million residents in all 68 Lower Peninsula counties.

            "full_description": "Sao Paulo: Ultra-processed foods are having a negative impact on the diversity of plant species available for human consumption while also damaging human and planetary health, according to a commentary published in the journal BMJ Global Health. Ultra-processed foods such as sweetened or salty snacks, soft drinks, instant noodles, reconstituted meat products, pre-prepared pizza and pasta dishes, biscuits and confectionery, are made by assembling food substances, mostly commodity ingredients, and 'cosmetic' additives (notably flavours, colours and emulsifiers) through a series of industrial processes. Nutrition experts from Brazil, the US and Australia have investigated the issue and warned that these products are the basis of a 'globalised diet' and are becoming dominant in the global food supply, with sales and consumption growing in all regions and almost all countries, particularly in the upper-middle-income and lower-middle income countries. According to the experts, the global agrobiodiversity - the variety and variability of animals, plants and microorganisms used directly or indirectly for food and agriculture -- is declining, especially the genetic diversity of plants used for human consumption. Peoples' diets are becoming less diverse, with ultra-processed foods replacing the variety of wholefoods necessary for a balanced and healthy diet. As much as 90 percent of humanity's energy intake comes from just 15 crop plants, and more than four billion people rely on just three of them - rice, wheat and maize. Production of ultra-processed foods involved greater use of ingredients extracted from a handful of high-yielding plant species (such as maize, wheat, soy and oil seed crops) which meant that animal-sourced ingredients used in many ultra-processed foods were often derived from confined animals fed on the same crops. Another issue of concern was that ultra-processed food production used large quantities of land, water, energy, herbicides and fertilisers, causing environmental degradation from greenhouse gas emissions and accumulation of packaging waste. \"The very rapid rise of ultra-processed foods in human diets will continue to place pressure on the diversity of plant species available for human consumption,\" said Fernanda Helena Marrocos Leite, from the School of Public Health at University of Sao Paulo in Brazil, and her team. \"Future global food systems fora, biodiversity conventions and climate change conferences need to highlight the destruction of agrobiodiversity caused by ultra-processed foods, and to agree on policies and actions designed to slow and reverse this disaster,\" Leite added.",

Here is what\u2019s on the radar of our editors for the morning of March 30 \u2026 What we are watching in Canada \u2026 The chief of a First Nation searching for unmarked graves at a former residential school in British Columbia says they\u2019re looking for long-term funding as they prepare for a visit today by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Chief Willie Sellars from Williams Lake First Nation says his community, along with others conducting similar investigations at former government-funded, church-run institutions across Canada need financial support for their work from start to finish. He says reconciliation starts with a healthy community, and they also need long-term funding to support the mental health and well-being of residential school survivors, their families, and Indigenous communities. The First Nation in B.C.\u2019s central interior announced in January that a preliminary geophysical investigation had found 93 \u201creflections\u201d that could indicate children buried around the site of the former St. Joseph\u2019s Mission Residential School. He says they need Ottawa to provide complete records about the institution, along with support in urging the Roman Catholic Church to do the same, as they work to identify children who never returned home. Sellars says the federal government\u2019s role in advancing reconciliation should also include support for economic development and key community needs, like housing. The investigation at St. Joseph\u2019s came after ground-penetrating radar located what are believed to be more than 200 graves at a former institution in Kamloops last year. Trudeau told media in Vancouver on Tuesday that he was looking forward to meeting with Sellars to talk about the challenges and hardships his community and others have experienced since the finding of unmarked graves. \u2014 Also this \u2026 A former junior hockey player with life-altering injuries from a bus crash in Saskatchewan is getting a boost he\u2019s been anticipating for two years. Ryan Straschnitzki was paralyzed from the chest down when a bus carrying the Humboldt Broncos was in a crash in 2018, killing 16 and injuring three others. He had an epidural implant in his spine three years ago to help stimulate nerves and move limbs. Since receiving the implant, Straschnitzki has been able to stand on his own and take a few steps with a walker. This week, the 22-year-old is having the stimulator reprogrammed in Calgary to make sure it continues to work efficiently. A planned upgrade was delayed for two years because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Straschnitzki, who hopes to excel at sledge hockey, says has been working to improve his core strength. He says he is hopeful the upgrade will help him continue to make progress, because over time bodies get adapted to certain stimulation. \u2014 What we are watching in the U.S. \u2026 SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Tuesday blocked parole for Charles Manson follower Leslie Van Houten, reversing a panel\u2019s recommendation that she be freed after spending a half-century in prison. Van Houten, 72, \u201ccurrently poses an unreasonable danger to society if released from prison at this time,\u201d Newsom said in his parole review. It was the fifth time that a California governor has rejected her release. Her attorney, Rich Pfeiffer, disputed that view and said the decision will be appealed in court. He accused Newsom of rejecting parole because he is worried about \u201chis political future\u201d and noted that Van Houten has a spotless prison disciplinary record. Van Houten is serving a life sentence for helping Manson and others kill Los Angeles grocer Leno LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary, in August 1969. Van Houten was 19 when she and other cult members fatally stabbed the LaBiancas and smeared the couple\u2019s blood on the walls. The day before, other Manson followers, not including Van Houten, killed pregnant actress Sharon Tate and four others. In his rejection letter, Newsom noted that Van Housen had undergone therapy, earned educational degrees and taken self-help classes in prison and had shown \u201cincreased maturity and rehabilitation.\u201d But Van Houten also has \u201cgaps in insight\u201d that continue to make her a danger to society, Newsom said. Van Houten has had 21 parole hearings since 1982. Most parole boards denied her bid for freedom. But five panels have recommended her release since 2016, saying she had expressed remorse and was no longer a threat to public safety. Newsom rejected a recommendation made last November, and previously reversed parole recommendations in 2019 and 2020. In February, the California Supreme Court refused to hear Van Houten\u2019s appeal of the 2020 rejection. \u2014 What we are watching in the rest of the world \u2026 KYIV, Ukraine _ Russia\u2019s pledge to scale back some military operations in Ukraine drew skepticism even as the two nations planned to return Wednesday to talks that could produce a framework for ending the war that has imposed an increasingly punishing toll. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said there was no reason to believe Russia\u2019s announcement that it would reduce military activity near Kyiv, the capital, as well as in the northern city of Chernihiv, given what\u2019s still happening on the ground. \u201cWe can call those signals that we hear at the negotiations positive,\u201d he said in his nightly video address to the Ukrainian people. \u201cBut those signals don\u2019t silence the explosions of Russian shells.\u201d It was a bitter reality check in a rare moment of optimism five weeks into what has devolved into a bloody war of attrition, with thousands dead and almost 4 million Ukrainians fleeing the country. Earlier Tuesday, Ukraine\u2019s delegation at the conference, held in Istanbul, laid out a framework under which the country would declare itself neutral and its security would be guaranteed by an array of other nations. Moscow\u2019s public reaction was positive, and the negotiations were expected to resume Wednesday in Istanbul. Meanwhile, Germany triggered an early warning level for natural gas supplies and called on consumers to save energy amid concerns that Russia could cut off deliveries unless it is paid in rubles. Western nations have rejected the Russian demand for ruble payments, arguing it would undermine the sanctions imposed against Moscow over the war in Ukraine. \u2014 On this day in 1972 \u2026 Canadian sailors got a daily rum ration for the last time, ending a navy tradition dating back to 1667. \u2014 In entertainment \u2026 NEW YORK _ Foo Fighters have cancelled all upcoming concert dates following the death of the band\u2019s drummer, Taylor Hawkins. The rockers had been scheduled to play at the Grammy Awards in Las Vegas on Sunday as well as spring dates at the Beale Street Music Festival; the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival; Columbia, Maryland; Raleigh, North Carolina; Daytona Beach; Charlotte, North Carolina; the Boston Calling Music Festival; and summer dates in Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, France and the UK. \u201cIt is with great sadness that Foo Fighters confirm the cancellation of all upcoming tour dates in light of the staggering loss of our brother,\u201d the band said in a statement Tuesday. Hawkins died Friday during a South American tour with the rock band. He was 50. \u201cWe\u2019re sorry for and share in the disappointment that we won\u2019t be seeing one another as planned,\u201d the band\u2019s statement read. \u201cInstead, let\u2019s take this time to grieve, to heal, to pull our loved ones close, and to appreciate all the music and memories we\u2019ve made together.\u201d Hawkins was Alanis Morissette\u2019s touring drummer when he joined Foo Fighters in 1997. He played on the band\u2019s biggest albums including \u201cOne by One\u201d and \u201cIn Your Honor,\u201d and on hit singles like \u201cBest of You.\u201d In lead singer David Grohl\u2019s 2021 book \u201cThe Storyteller,\u201d he called Hawkins his \u201cbrother from another mother, my best friend, a man for whom I would take a bullet.\u201d \u2014 Did you see this? OTTAWA _ Canada\u2019s Conservatives continue to reject the target the Liberal government set for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, as the party searches for a new leader who will decide its approach to tackle climate change. On Tuesday, the federal government released its plan for how it hopes to achieve its latest goal, which is to cut carbon-related pollution by 40 to 45 per cent from 2005 levels by the end of the decade. Tory environment critic Kyle Seeback says the party doesn\u2019t support that plan. Instead, it favours the target the Conservative government set back in 2015 under the leadership of former prime minister Stephen Harper. When he came into office later that year, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signed onto the plan, committing under the Paris agreement to reduce the country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. Last year Trudeau increased those targets ahead of international climate talks in the fall, saying Canada now aims for 40 to 45 per cent below 2005 levels. \u201cIt\u2019s great to intend things and to hope for things,\u201d Seeback said on Tuesday. \u201cWhat we need (are) actual plans that result in emission reductions and what we get from this government are plans that cost a lot of money.\u201d He pointed out that the Liberals have failed to achieve past climate goals and dismissed the plan presented Tuesday as lacking in details about the impact the reductions would have on resource-based industries and taxpayers. \u201cI\u2019m all for aspirational things, but at the end of the day, what we need are plans that actually work and don\u2019t have incredibly catastrophic effects on the Canadian economy.\u201d \u2014 This report by The Canadian Press was first published March 30, 2022.

Moscow\u2019s public reaction was positive, and the negotiations were expected to resume Wednesday in Istanbul. Meanwhile, Germany triggered an early warning level for natural gas supplies and called on consumers to save energy amid concerns that Russia could cut off deliveries unless it is paid in rubles.

OTTAWA _ Canada\u2019s Conservatives continue to reject the target the Liberal government set for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, as the party searches for a new leader who will decide its approach to tackle climate change. On Tuesday, the federal government released its plan for how it hopes to achieve its latest goal, which is to cut carbon-related pollution by 40 to 45 per cent from 2005 levels by the end of the decade. Tory environment critic Kyle Seeback says the party doesn\u2019t support that plan. Instead, it favours the target the Conservative government set back in 2015 under the leadership of former prime minister Stephen Harper. When he came into office later that year, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signed onto the plan, committing under the Paris agreement to reduce the country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. Last year Trudeau increased those targets ahead of international climate talks in the fall, saying Canada now aims for 40 to 45 per cent below 2005 levels. \u201cIt\u2019s great to intend things and to hope for things,\u201d Seeback said on Tuesday. \u201cWhat we need (are) actual plans that result in emission reductions and what we get from this government are plans that cost a lot of money.\u201d He pointed out that the Liberals have failed to achieve past climate goals and dismissed the plan presented Tuesday as lacking in details about the impact the reductions would have on resource-based industries and taxpayers. \u201cI\u2019m all for aspirational things, but at the end of the day, what we need are plans that actually work and don\u2019t have incredibly catastrophic effects on the Canadian economy.\u201d \u2014 This report by The Canadian Press was first published March 30, 2022.

Here is what\u2019s on the radar of our editors for the morning of March 30 \u2026 What we are watching in Canada \u2026 The chief of a First Nation searching for unmarked graves at a former residential school in British Columbia says they\u2019re looking for long-term funding as they prepare for a visit today by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Chief Willie Sellars from Williams Lake First Nation says his community, along with others conducting similar investigations at former government-funded, church-run institutions across Canada need financial support for their work from start to finish. He says reconciliation starts with a healthy community, and they also need long-term funding to support the mental health and well-being of residential school survivors, their families, and Indigenous communities. The First Nation in B.C.\u2019s central interior announced in January that a preliminary geophysical investigation had found 93 \u201creflections\u201d that could indicate children buried around the site of the former St. Joseph\u2019s Mission Residential School. He says they need Ottawa to provide complete records about the institution, along with support in urging the Roman Catholic Church to do the same, as they work to identify children who never returned home. Sellars says the federal government\u2019s role in advancing reconciliation should also include support for economic development and key community needs, like housing. The investigation at St. Joseph\u2019s came after ground-penetrating radar located what are believed to be more than 200 graves at a former institution in Kamloops last year. Trudeau told media in Vancouver on Tuesday that he was looking forward to meeting with Sellars to talk about the challenges and hardships his community and others have experienced since the finding of unmarked graves. \u2014 Also this \u2026 A former junior hockey player with life-altering injuries from a bus crash in Saskatchewan is getting a boost he\u2019s been anticipating for two years. Ryan Straschnitzki was paralyzed from the chest down when a bus carrying the Humboldt Broncos was in a crash in 2018, killing 16 and injuring three others. He had an epidural implant in his spine three years ago to help stimulate nerves and move limbs. Since receiving the implant, Straschnitzki has been able to stand on his own and take a few steps with a walker. This week, the 22-year-old is having the stimulator reprogrammed in Calgary to make sure it continues to work efficiently. A planned upgrade was delayed for two years because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Straschnitzki, who hopes to excel at sledge hockey, says has been working to improve his core strength. He says he is hopeful the upgrade will help him continue to make progress, because over time bodies get adapted to certain stimulation. \u2014 What we are watching in the U.S. \u2026 SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Tuesday blocked parole for Charles Manson follower Leslie Van Houten, reversing a panel\u2019s recommendation that she be freed after spending a half-century in prison. Van Houten, 72, \u201ccurrently poses an unreasonable danger to society if released from prison at this time,\u201d Newsom said in his parole review. It was the fifth time that a California governor has rejected her release. Her attorney, Rich Pfeiffer, disputed that view and said the decision will be appealed in court. He accused Newsom of rejecting parole because he is worried about \u201chis political future\u201d and noted that Van Houten has a spotless prison disciplinary record. Van Houten is serving a life sentence for helping Manson and others kill Los Angeles grocer Leno LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary, in August 1969. Van Houten was 19 when she and other cult members fatally stabbed the LaBiancas and smeared the couple\u2019s blood on the walls. The day before, other Manson followers, not including Van Houten, killed pregnant actress Sharon Tate and four others. In his rejection letter, Newsom noted that Van Housen had undergone therapy, earned educational degrees and taken self-help classes in prison and had shown \u201cincreased maturity and rehabilitation.\u201d But Van Houten also has \u201cgaps in insight\u201d that continue to make her a danger to society, Newsom said. Van Houten has had 21 parole hearings since 1982. Most parole boards denied her bid for freedom. But five panels have recommended her release since 2016, saying she had expressed remorse and was no longer a threat to public safety. Newsom rejected a recommendation made last November, and previously reversed parole recommendations in 2019 and 2020. In February, the California Supreme Court refused to hear Van Houten\u2019s appeal of the 2020 rejection. \u2014 What we are watching in the rest of the world \u2026 KYIV, Ukraine _ Russia\u2019s pledge to scale back some military operations in Ukraine drew skepticism even as the two nations planned to return Wednesday to talks that could produce a framework for ending the war that has imposed an increasingly punishing toll.

            "full_description": "A new study of the Permian Basin in New Mexico shows it leaked the greenhouse gas at double the expected rate from 2018 through 2020. Article courtesy of MIT Technology Review . By Casey Crownhart One of the largest and fastest-growing oil production sites in the US is emitting far more methane than previously measured. It\u2019s well known that oil and natural-gas production is a significant source of the powerful greenhouse gas: methane that is trapped underground leaks out from wells and pipelines, and it can also be released intentionally through venting and flaring, or burning. But an aerial survey of the Permian Basin in New Mexico revealed more leakage than even the highest estimates had suggested to date. Methane is an important greenhouse gas: while it\u2019s much less abundant than carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and has a shorter life span once emitted, it\u2019s about 86 times better at trapping heat. According to the new study , the site emits about 194 metric tons of the gas every hour. That\u2019s about 9% of the site\u2019s total natural-gas production, double previous estimates. Researchers and environmental groups have long been monitoring the area, which spans across New Mexico and Texas, because it is well known as a methane hot spot. From ground monitoring by towers to satellite measurements , those previous studies suggested that methane emissions from the site amounted to under 4% of total natural-gas production in the area. \u201cWe were initially surprised by the magnitude,\u201d says Yuanlei Chen, a graduate student at Stanford\u2019s Energy Resources Engineering program and one of the authors of the study. The airplane taking measurements was able to cover about 100 times more sites than previous ground surveys. By flying over active wells and pipelines in the New Mexico section of the basin, the plane detected 1,985 methane plumes over the course of 15 months. In addition to discovering higher levels of methane leakage than expected, the survey also identified a few mega-emitting sites. Just about 5% of the plumes that the plane detected were responsible for over half the measured emissions. The findings add to calls for toughening methane regulations on oil and gas producers. At the time this data was collected, from 2018 through 2020, oil production was increasing quickly, and regulations in the area were looser than they are today. New Mexico recently passed legislation banning routine flaring of excess natural gas. Stronger federal policies are still needed to cut emissions in other oil-producing states like Texas, says Jon Goldstein , a senior policy director at the Environmental Defense Fund.

The new findings show how comprehensive surveys can shed light on methane emissions, which are often poorly understood even in major oil and gas basins like the Permian Basin . In any case, the new findings show how comprehensive surveys can shed light on methane emissions, which are often poorly understood even in major oil and gas basins like the Permian. As governments continue to target emissions, identifying problem spots can be a useful first step. Appreciate CleanTechnica\u2019s originality?

The drop in pollution from tailpipes and power plants would prevent up to 110,000 premature deaths by 2050, the report projects. It would also avoid 2.78 million asthma attacks and 13.4 million lost workdays. All in all, that would amount to $1.2 trillion in public health benefits. That\u2019s assuming all new passenger cars sold in the US are EVs by 2035 and all new heavy-duty vehicles sold are electric by 2040. What\u2019s more, those vehicles would need to be powered by a fossil fuel-free grid. But replacing the vast majority of the nation\u2019s roughly 280 million cars and trucks on the road with electric vehicles in such a short timeframe remains virtually impossible. Just under 3 percent of new vehicles purchased in the US in 2021 are electric, despite their growing popularity. \u201cI can\u2019t ensure that they have clean, healthy air to breathe \u2014 and that is incredibly frustrating to me\u201d Regardless, the health advocates say a safe environment should be non-negotiable. \u201cI can advise [my patients] to limit their time spent outside to limit the pollution they are breathing; I can\u2019t ensure that they have clean, healthy air to breathe \u2014 and that is incredibly frustrating to me,\u201d Afif El-Hasan, a pediatrician and American Lung Association volunteer, said on a press call. \u201cIt should be a right of every child to play and develop somewhere safe. That should not be up for debate ever.\u201d More than four in 10 Americans live in a place with unhealthy levels of air pollution, according to the American Lung Association. Breathing in that pollution has been tied to cancer, heart attacks, strokes, and lung diseases. It can lead to impaired lung development in children, which can then affect them throughout their lives. Americans of color are also disproportionately burdened by air pollution, according to the American Lung Association; they\u2019re three times more likely to be breathing the worst air pollution compared to white Americans. For its new report, the American Lung Association looked at how phasing out fossil fuel combustion from the transportation and power sectors would limit key pollutants. That includes soot, smog-forming nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds, and sulfur dioxide coming from tailpipes and smokestacks. The report authors also studied another type of pollution that often flies under the radar and which electric vehicles are still responsible for: non-exhaust emissions. That includes particles that enter the air from the wear-and-tear of roads and vehicles, say from tires or brake pads. The persistence of this type of pollution shows why better public transportation and more walkable cities \u2014 to reduce reliance on driving \u2014 are also important for a healthier future. The report also points out health benefits from cutting down greenhouse gas emissions that drive climate change. A warming climate affects air quality by speeding up the chemical reaction that produces smog and exacerbating pollution from wildfires. E-bikes, scooters, and other light electric vehicles can also significantly cut down greenhouse gas pollution when they replace cars, according to a recent industry-commissioned report produced by the German Aerospace Center. In the US, President Joe Biden has set a goal of getting half of all new cars sold in the US by 2030 to be electric or hybrid vehicles. Earlier this month, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed new regulation specifically aimed at slashing pollution from trucks. The Biden administration\u2019s climate goals also include achieving a clean power sector by 2035. Phasing out fossil fuels from the power grid is essential for cleaning up transportation, the American Lung Association report highlights. And while many of these efforts remain aspirations for the future, pollution continues to take its toll on people\u2019s health now.",

Nutrition experts from Brazil, the US and Australia have investigated the issue and warned that these products are the basis of a 'globalised diet' and are becoming dominant in the global food supply, with sales and consumption growing in all regions and almost all countries, particularly in the upper-middle-income and lower-middle income countries. According to the experts, the global agrobiodiversity - the variety and variability of animals, plants and microorganisms used directly or indirectly for food and agriculture \u2014 is declining, especially the genetic diversity of plants used for human consumption. Peoples' diets are becoming less diverse, with ultra-processed foods replacing the variety of wholefoods necessary for a balanced and healthy diet. As much as 90 per cent of humanity's energy intake comes from just 15 crop plants, and more than four billion people rely on just three of them - rice, wheat and maize. Production of ultra-processed foods involved greater use of ingredients extracted from a handful of high-yielding plant species (such as maize, wheat, soy and oil seed crops) which meant that animal-sourced ingredients used in many ultra-processed foods were often derived from confined animals fed on the same crops. Another issue of concern was that ultra-processed food production used large quantities of land, water, energy, herbicides and fertilisers, causing environmental degradation from greenhouse gas emissions and accumulation of packaging waste. \"The very rapid rise of ultra-processed foods in human diets will continue to place pressure on the diversity of plant species available for human consumption,\" said Fernanda Helena Marrocos Leite, from the School of Public Health at University of Sao Paulo in Brazil, and her team. \"Future global food systems fora, biodiversity conventions and climate change conferences need to highlight the destruction of agrobiodiversity caused by ultra-processed foods, and to agree on policies and actions designed to slow and reverse this disaster,\" Leite added.

            "full_description": "OTTAWA \u2014 Canada\u2019s Conservatives continue to reject the target the Liberal government set for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, as the party searches for a new leader who will decide its approach to tackle climate change. On Tuesday, the federal government released its plan for how it hopes to achieve its latest goal, which is to cut carbon-related pollution by 40 to 45 per cent from 2005 levels by the end of the decade. Tory environment critic Kyle Seeback says the party doesn\u2019t support that plan. Instead, it favours the target the Conservative government set back in 2015 under the leadership of former prime minister Stephen Harper. When he came into office later that year, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signed onto the plan, committing under the Paris agreement to reduce the country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. Last year Trudeau increased those targets ahead of international climate talks in the fall, saying Canada now aims for 40 to 45 per cent below 2005 levels. \u201cIt\u2019s great to intend things and to hope for things,\u201d Seeback said on Tuesday. \u201cWhat we need (are) actual plans that result in emission reductions and what we get from this government are plans that cost a lot of money.\u201d He pointed out that the Liberals have failed to achieve past climate goals and dismissed the plan presented Tuesday as lacking in details about the impact the reductions would have on resource-based industries and taxpayers. \u201cI\u2019m all for aspirational things, but at the end of the day, what we need are plans that actually work and don\u2019t have incredibly catastrophic effects on the Canadian economy.\u201d Conservative leadership contenders will need to address their ideas for the country\u2019s approach to climate change as they compete for the party\u2019s top job. The new leader is set to be announced Sept. 10. Much of the party\u2019s support comes from Western Canada, home to oil-producing provinces that want to ensure the sector\u2019s survival. At the same time, the Tories have also had to deal with criticism that they didn\u2019t present a plan to properly tackle climate change during the 2019 federal election campaign. Candidates have kicked off the first weeks of the current race by championing a rallying cry from 2019 that remains popular with the grassroots: a promise to scrap the carbon price. That\u2019s something many members are excited to hear after former leader Erin O\u2019Toole promised a carbon price of his own in an effort to course-correct during the most recent election. Ottawa-area MP Pierre Poilievre has been beating that drum and plans to hold a rally in the nation\u2019s capital Friday against the scheduled rise in the federal charge, which is set to take effect that day. Poilievre didn\u2019t directly answer when asked whether he supports the current government\u2019s 2030 targets, but in a statement Tuesday said Trudeau would \u201cdrive up energy prices at home and oil production abroad.\u201d He is campaigning on a promise to build more pipelines and end Canada\u2019s foreign oil imports. When it comes to combating climate change, he vows to reduce emissions through \u201ctechnology and not taxes.\u201d \u201cThese technologies include carbon capture, emissions-free nuclear power and helping other countries shut down their coal-fired power plants by exporting them cleaner natural gas, nuclear power and hydroelectricity,\u201d Poilievre said in a statement. In another statement, Michelle Coates Mather, a spokeswoman for Jean Charest \u2014 the former Quebec premier who introduced a cap-and-trade system for that province \u2014 said he would release his plan for the environment in the \u201cweeks ahead.\u201d \u201cMr. Charest agrees with lowering emissions,\u201d she wrote, adding he\u2019s the only candidate \u201cwho has a track record on emissions and cutting pollution.\u201d Since he entered the race, Charest has expressed support for carbon pricing, but has so far declined to say when he endorses one for consumer goods, like fuel. On Tuesday, Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown also sidestepped a question about his support for Canada\u2019s 2030 targets. He tweeted that Ottawa should forgo its planned increase to the federal carbon price and pledged to make sure the Conservative party has a climate plan that protects the energy sector and taxpayers. Scott Aitchison, a rural Ontario MP who\u2019s running for leader, said in a statement that he supports \u201cCanada\u2019s original Paris commitments\u201d and believes in the need to shore up the country\u2019s infrastructure against the effects of climate change to mitigate costs.",

            "full_description": "OTTAWA \u2014 Canada\u2019s Conservatives continue to reject the target the Liberal government set for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, as the party searches for a new leader who will decide its approach to tackle climate change. On Tuesday, the federal government released its plan for how it hopes to achieve its latest goal, which is to cut carbon-related pollution by 40 to 45 per cent from 2005 levels by the end of the decade. Tory environment critic Kyle Seeback says the party doesn\u2019t support that plan. Instead, it favours the target the Conservative government set back in 2015 under the leadership of former prime minister Stephen Harper. When he came into office later that year, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signed onto the plan, committing under the Paris agreement to reduce the country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. Last year Trudeau increased those targets ahead of international climate talks in the fall, saying Canada now aims for 40 to 45 per cent below 2005 levels. \u201cIt\u2019s great to intend things and to hope for things,\u201d Seeback said on Tuesday. \u201cWhat we need (are) actual plans that result in emission reductions and what we get from this government are plans that cost a lot of money.\u201d He pointed out that the Liberals have failed to achieve past climate goals and dismissed the plan presented Tuesday as lacking in details about the impact the reductions would have on resource-based industries and taxpayers. \u201cI\u2019m all for aspirational things, but at the end of the day, what we need are plans that actually work and don\u2019t have incredibly catastrophic effects on the Canadian economy.\u201d Conservative leadership contenders will need to address their ideas for the country\u2019s approach to climate change as they compete for the party\u2019s top job. The new leader is set to be announced Sept. 10. Much of the party\u2019s support comes from Western Canada, home to oil-producing provinces that want to ensure the sector\u2019s survival. At the same time, the Tories have also had to deal with criticism that they didn\u2019t present a plan to properly tackle climate change during the 2019 federal election campaign. Candidates have kicked off the first weeks of the current race by championing a rallying cry from 2019 that remains popular with the grassroots: a promise to scrap the carbon price.

In another statement, Michelle Coates Mather, a spokeswoman for Jean Charest \u2014 the former Quebec premier who introduced a cap-and-trade system for that province \u2014 said he would release his plan for the environment in the \"weeks ahead.\" \"Mr. Charest agrees with lowering emissions,\" she wrote, adding he's the only candidate \"who has a track record on emissions and cutting pollution.\" Since he entered the race, Charest has expressed support for carbon pricing, but has so far declined to say when he endorses one for consumer goods, like fuel. On Tuesday, Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown also sidestepped a question about his support for Canada's 2030 targets. He tweeted that Ottawa should forgo its planned increase to the federal carbon price and pledged to make sure the Conservative party has a climate plan that protects the energy sector and taxpayers. Scott Aitchison, a rural Ontario MP who's running for leader, said in a statement that he supports \"Canada's original Paris commitments\" and believes in the need to shore up the country's infrastructure against the effects of climate change to mitigate costs.

            "full_description": "OTTAWA -- Canada's Conservatives continue to reject the target the Liberal government set for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, as the party searches for a new leader who will decide its approach to tackle climate change. On Tuesday, the federal government released its plan for how it hopes to achieve its latest goal, which is to cut carbon-related pollution by 40 to 45 per cent from 2005 levels by the end of the decade. Tory environment critic Kyle Seeback says the party doesn't support that plan. Instead, it favours the target the Conservative government set back in 2015 under the leadership of former prime minister Stephen Harper. When he came into office later that year, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signed onto the plan, committing under the Paris agreement to reduce the country's greenhouse gas emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. Last year Trudeau increased those targets ahead of international climate talks in the fall, saying Canada now aims for 40 to 45 per cent below 2005 levels. \"It's great to intend things and to hope for things,\" Seeback said on Tuesday. \"What we need (are) actual plans that result in emission reductions and what we get from this government are plans that cost a lot of money.\" He pointed out that the Liberals have failed to achieve past climate goals and dismissed the plan presented Tuesday as lacking in details about the impact the reductions would have on resource-based industries and taxpayers. \"I'm all for aspirational things, but at the end of the day, what we need are plans that actually work and don't have incredibly catastrophic effects on the Canadian economy.\" Conservative leadership contenders will need to address their ideas for the country's approach to climate change as they compete for the party's top job. The new leader is set to be announced Sept. 10. Much of the party's support comes from Western Canada, home to oil-producing provinces that want to ensure the sector's survival. At the same time, the Tories have also had to deal with criticism that they didn't present a plan to properly tackle climate change during the 2019 federal election campaign. Candidates have kicked off the first weeks of the current race by championing a rallying cry from 2019 that remains popular with the grassroots: a promise to scrap the carbon price. That's something many members are excited to hear after former leader Erin O'Toole promised a carbon price of his own in an effort to course correct during the most recent election. Ottawa-area MP Pierre Poilievre has been beating that drum and plans to hold a rally in the nation's capital Friday against the scheduled rise in the federal charge, which is set to take effect that day. Poilievre didn't directly answer when asked whether he supports the current government's 2030 targets, but in a statement Tuesday said Trudeau would \"drive up energy prices at home and oil production abroad.\" He is campaigning on a promise to build more pipelines and end Canada's foreign oil imports.

            "full_description": "OTTAWA \u2014 Canada's Conservatives continue to reject the target the Liberal government set for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, as the party searches for a new leader who will decide its approach to tackle climate change. On Tuesday, the federal government released its plan for how it hopes to achieve its latest goal, which is to cut carbon-related pollution by 40 to 45 per cent from 2005 levels by the end of the decade. Tory environment critic Kyle Seeback says the party doesn't support that plan. Instead, it favours the target the Conservative government set back in 2015 under the leadership of former prime minister Stephen Harper. When he came into office later that year, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signed onto the plan, committing under the Paris agreement to reduce the country's greenhouse gas emissions to 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. Last year Trudeau increased those targets ahead of international climate talks in the fall, saying Canada now aims for 40 to 45 per cent below 2005 levels. \"It's great to intend things and to hope for things,\" Seeback said on Tuesday. \"What we need (are) actual plans that result in emission reductions and what we get from this government are plans that cost a lot of money.\" He pointed out that the Liberals have failed to achieve past climate goals and dismissed the plan presented Tuesday as lacking in details about the impact the reductions would have on resource-based industries and taxpayers. \"I'm all for aspirational things, but at the end of the day, what we need are plans that actually work and don't have incredibly catastrophic effects on the Canadian economy.\" Conservative leadership contenders will need to address their ideas for the country's approach to climate change as they compete for the party's top job. The new leader is set to be announced Sept. 10. Much of the party's support comes from Western Canada, home to oil-producing provinces that want to ensure the sector's survival. At the same time, the Tories have also had to deal with criticism that they didn't present a plan to properly tackle climate change during the 2019 federal election campaign. Candidates have kicked off the first weeks of the current race by championing a rallying cry from 2019 that remains popular with the grassroots: a promise to scrap the carbon price. That's something many members are excited to hear after former leader Erin O'Toole promised a carbon price of his own in an effort to course correct during the most recent election. Ottawa-area MP Pierre Poilievre has been beating that drum and plans to hold a rally in the nation's capital Friday against the scheduled rise in the federal charge, which is set to take effect that day. Poilievre didn't directly answer when asked whether he supports the current government's 2030 targets, but in a statement Tuesday said Trudeau would \"drive up energy prices at home and oil production abroad.\" He is campaigning on a promise to build more pipelines and end Canada's foreign oil imports. When it comes to combating climate change, he vows to reduce emissions through \"technology and not taxes.\" \"These technologies include carbon capture, emissions-free nuclear power and helping other countries shut down their coal-fired power plants by exporting them cleaner natural gas, nuclear power and hydroelectricity,\" Poilievre said in a statement. In another statement, Michelle Coates Mather, a spokeswomen for Jean Charest \u2014 the former Quebec premier who introduced a cap-and-trade system for that province \u2014 said he would release his plan for the environment in the \"weeks ahead.\" \"Mr. Charest agrees with lowering emissions,\" she wrote, adding he's the only candidate \"who has a track record on emissions and cutting pollution.\" Since he entered the race, Charest has expressed support for carbon pricing, but has so far declined to say when he endorses one for consumer goods, like fuel. On Tuesday, Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown also sidestepped a question about his support for Canada's 2030 targets. He tweeted that Ottawa should forgo its planned increase to the federal carbon price and pledged to make sure the Conservative party has a climate plan that protects the energy sector and taxpayers. Scott Aitchison, a rural Ontario MP who's running for leader, said in a statement that he supports \"Canada's original Paris commitments\" and believes in the need to shore up the country's infrastructure against the effects of climate change to mitigate costs.

            "full_description": "OTTAWA\u2014The road map unveiled by the Liberals to slash greenhouse gas emissions will force the Conservative party to answer a major question: will they follow the plan if they end up in power? By 2030, the Liberals want to reduce emissions to at least 40 per cent below 2005 levels and on Tuesday unveiled a $9.1 billion plan to get there. The deadline falls five years after the next scheduled election, meaning when Canadians next go to the polls, work to achieve those targets will be well underway. That could have significant implications for the direction of Conservative climate policy, observers say. For Conservatives angling for an end to the carbon tax, for instance, the Liberals new plan could pose a major problem, said Michael Bernstein, executive director of Clean Prosperity, a policy think tank that advocates for market-based solutions to climate change. Among the details released Tuesday: the Liberals\u2019 desire to provide certainty around carbon price increases, which they say could involve legislation or contracts with industry. Bernstein said that approach \u2014 which he welcomed \u2014 will give the private sector the ability to plan and plot the investments they\u2019ll need to make in order to reduce emissions, especially if the government agrees to make up any differences. But it would make scrapping the carbon tax a costly proposition, said Bernstein. \u201cIt is going to make it more difficult and more expensive to remove the carbon tax if in fact that\u2019s what the next leader decides to do.\u201d Many of the candidates are already committed to going down that road. In recent days, their main talking point on carbon pricing has been the planned increase coming into effect this Friday, which both elected Tories and leadership candidates say is unfair in the context of rising prices overall and they\u2019ve been calling for a pause. Most candidates \u2014 including the front-runners Pierre Poilievre, Jean Charest and Patrick Brown \u2014 have also committed to scrapping the federal carbon tax. Brown and Poilievre both repeated the pledge on Tuesday. Elements of their climate plans are slowly coming together. In response to the Liberals Tuesday, Poilievre said he wants to reduce emissions through technology, while Brown said he will present a plan that \u201cthat protects our energy sector and your pocketbook.\u201d Having a robust approach to combating climate change is now taken as a must for the party to form government, and in an effort to help candidates understand that, a new working group called Conservatives for Clean Growth was formed by Conservative strategists and former politicians explicitly for the leadership race. The group is offering its help to campaigns to craft climate policy and has spoken to all of them. While detailed policy will emerge in the coming months, there have been glimpses of the direction some candidates will take. Charest, who implemented a carbon tax during his time as premier of Quebec, has suggested in recent interviews that he now backs only an industrial price, not a retail one. In a statement Tuesday, his campaign called the Liberals\u2019 new plan \u201c incomplete and unserious.\u201d \u201cIt does not specify the emissions caps that the government plans to impose on sectors, specifically oil and gas. That is not only unfair, it is reckless,\u201d his campaign said. The Liberals said what caps they will place on the oil and gas industry \u2014 responsible for more than a quarter of Canada\u2019s emissions in 2019 \u2014 will be developed via consultations this year. Those caps will have resonance for leadership candidates because of how much Conservative support lies in Canada\u2019s oil-producing provinces. Poilievre has suggested his plan to double Canada\u2019s oil and gas output is part of his climate change agenda, because it means cleaner Canadian energy can displace that produced in countries with fewer environmental regulations. An oft-repeated refrain among Tories is that driving down emissions is impossible without curtailing oil production and that in turn would devastate the economy. Brown recently rejected, for example, the concept of a \u201cjust transition,\u201d which provides federal support to workers who may be at risk of losing their jobs as the energy sectors realigns itself with emissions-reductions goals. \u201cThe only \u2018just transition\u2019 is Justin Trudeau transitioning out of office,\u201d Brown said in a policy statement on Western Canada, launched earlier this month. But, Bernstein pointed out, the Liberal plan showcases a path to emissions reductions with an increase in oil production. \u201cThe bar has been raised,\u201d he said. The Conservative leadership race is in its early days. Candidates have until April 29 to pay the full entry fee needed to run. To date, 10 people are trying to qualify: Poilievre, Brown, Charest, MPs Leslyn Lewis, Scott Aitchison and Marc Dalton, former MP Leona Alleslev, Ontario MPP Roman Baber, lawyer and former Tory candidate Joel Etienne, and Saskatchewan businessman Joseph Bourgault. The vote will take place via mail-in ballot and a winner will be announced on Sept. 10. Anyone can read Conversations, but to contribute, you should be registered Torstar account holder.

            "full_description": "Federal Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault on Tuesday unveiled a $9.1-billion climate change plan he says will achieve Canada\u2019s 2030 greenhouse gas emission reduction target, despite the fact it shows the Trudeau Liberals failed to meet their 2020 target. Canada\u2019s emissions in 2020 \u2014 the first year of the pandemic \u2014 haven\u2019t been formally announced yet, but a table in the 2030 plan says Canada\u2019s emissions in 2020 were 674 million tonnes. In 2016, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his government\u2019s target for 2020 \u2014 which used to be Stephen Harper\u2019s target \u2014 was to reduce Canada\u2019s emissions to 17% below 2005 levels by 2020. In the following years, Trudeau and his then-environment minister, Catherine McKenna, repeatedly assured Canadians the Liberals were on track to achieve that target. Canada\u2019s emissions in 2005 were 739 million tonnes, which means Trudeau\u2019s 2020 target was 613 million tonnes. That means the Trudeau government, according to its own numbers released on Tuesday, missed its 2020 target by 61 million tonnes \u2014 equivalent to the total emissions of Canada\u2019s electricity sector for all of 2019. This marks the ninth consecutive time in the past 34 years a Liberal or Conservative government has failed to meet an emission reduction target, going back to the Brian Mulroney government in 1988 and progressing through the Jean Chretien, Paul Martin, Harper, and Trudeau governments. No Canadian government has ever come close to hitting a single emissions reduction target it has set for itself. Guilbeault\u2019s new plan says the measures the Trudeau government is now taking will reduce Canada\u2019s emissions by 36.4% compared to 2005 levels by 2030, meaning that with eight years to go, it is poised to achieve Trudeau\u2019s 2030 target of reducing emissions to at least 40% below 2005 levels by 2030. But based on the performance of Canadian governments going back to 1988, believing any government, Liberal or Conservative, is ever going to hit a climate target it sets for itself is the equivalent of believing that this time, Lucy isn\u2019t going to pull out the football from under Charlie Brown. Given that the best indicator of future performance is past practice, Canadian governments now have a perfect record of failing to meet nine different emission reduction targets going back to 1988. In addition, it\u2019s getting harder and harder to follow the logic behind the numbers in these projections. In the latest plan, for example, the Trudeau government predicts Canada\u2019s emissions are going to be the same in 2021 as they were in 2020. That makes no sense because while Canada\u2019s emissions for 2021 won\u2019t be reported until 2023, 2020 emissions were significantly reduced because of the global recession caused by the first year of the pandemic. In 2021, emissions dramatically rose all over the world as economies began to recover from the pandemic and there\u2019s no reason to think the same thing didn\u2019t happen in Canada. Beyond that, the government keeps changing emission levels retroactively. In 2021, for example, it suddenly raised Canada\u2019s emissions for the base year of 2005 to 739 million tonnes from the 730 million tonnes it reported in 2020, retroactively improving the government\u2019s alleged performance on reducing emissions by 9 million tonnes. The latest report from the federal Environment Ministry is also now including projected future emission cuts from land use and forestry practices, which it hasn\u2019t done in the past, which isn\u2019t part of its climate modelling, and which comes from a different government ministry \u2014 natural resources.",

            "content": "OTTAWA \u2014 Canada has had at least 11 different climate plans and nine emissions targets since 1988. Here\u2019s a snapshot of some of them. 1988: Canada hosts a conference in Toronto called Changing Atmosphere: Implications for Global Security, where governments and NGOs agree that human behaviour is affecting the atmosphere. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney gives the opening address, and by the end of the event, parties agree to strive to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 20 per cent below 1988 levels by 2005. 1990: The Mulroney government releases the Green Plan, which includes $175 million for about two dozen new policies on greenhouse gas emissions, including investments in energy efficiency, alternative energy and tree planting. It sets a goal to \u201cstabilize\u201d emissions at 1990 levels by 2000. 1992: Canada signs the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Rio de Janeiro, which sets up the next three decades of global conferences to address greenhouse gas emissions. 1993: In the federal election, Liberal Leader Jean Chr\u00e9tien promises to cut emissions to 80 per cent of what they were in 1988 by 2005, the same target Mulroney agreed to in 1988. 1995: Chretien\u2019s government introduces the National Action Program on Climate Change, promising to cut 66 million tonnes of emissions from current levels in 15 years. The plan includes more than 400 possible projects or programs, such as retrofitting federal buildings, updating the national building code to identify thermal efficiencies and convincing industry to voluntarily submit climate plans. 1997: Canada agrees to the Kyoto Protocol, an extension of the UN climate framework. It sets a new target to cut emissions to six per cent below 1990 levels by 2012. 1998: The federal government introduces its new Action Plan 2000 on Climate Change to work toward its Kyoto target, with a $500-million investment over five years. It includes goals to improve vehicle fuel efficiency, investments in renewable energy and a promise to look further at using carbon capture and storage technology in the oil and gas sector. 2002: Climate Change Plan for Canada, another pathway toward the Kyoto target, talks about emissions credits trading, increased use of ethanol and biodiesel, investments in public transit and aiming to retrofit one-fifth of commercial and institutional buildings by 2010. 2005: Project Green: A Plan for Honouring our Kyoto Commitment followed the 2005 federal budget, which included more than $3 billion in climate investments, including funds to encourage wind power and other renewable energy options and tax incentives for efficient energy generation. The latest plan encourages the development of a domestic emissions credit trading system, and promises to regulate emissions from certain industries. 2007: Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper, a year after saying Canada wouldn\u2019t be able to meet the Kyoto target, sets a new goal to cut emissions to 20 per cent below 2006 levels by 2020. It\u2019s the first to base its action mostly on cutting emissions intensity \u2014 the amount of greenhouse gas produced per unit of production, such as per barrel of oil, or tonne of steel. 2009: Canada signs the Copenhagen Accord, a new global climate plan under which Canada promises to cut emissions 17 per cent below 2005 levels by 2020. 2011: Canada formally withdraws from the Kyoto Protocol. 2015: Environment Minister Leona Aglukkaq submits a new national emissions target ahead of a major UN climate conference in Paris. The new target, 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, comes with promises to cut methane emissions in the oil and gas sector, and regulations for natural gas power plants and fertilizer production. In November, just weeks after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the Liberals win the election and take office, Canada signs the Paris agreement at that UN conference, using the same Conservative targets. 2016: Trudeau surprises and angers some premiers with a sudden plan to impose a minimum price on pollution on provinces without their own similar plan. Shortly after, most provinces sign on the Pan-Canadian Framework for Clean Growth and Climate Change, which shows a path of policies to get Canada much of the way to the Paris target. They include the carbon price, as well as better building codes, eliminating coal power and a clean fuel standard to reduce emissions generated by burning fuels. 2020: Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson introduces a \u201cstrengthened\u201d climate plan aiming to introduce more measures to try and meet the original 2030 target and start working toward net-zero emissions by 2050. A Healthy Environment and a Healthy Economy promises to keep increasing the carbon price until it reaches $170 a tonne in 2030, and to invest in clean technology and a national clean electricity grid. 2021: Canada submits updated emissions targets to the UN, now aiming for 40 to 45 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. It also passes the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act, which enshrines the targets into law for the first time, and requires regular reporting and reviews of progress. 2022: Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault introduces the Emissions Reduction Plan, showing the path to getting to the new 2030 targets.

            "full_description": "OTTAWA \u2014 Canada has had at least 11 different climate plans and nine emissions targets since 1988. Here\u2019s a snapshot of some of them. 1988: Canada hosts a conference in Toronto called Changing Atmosphere: Implications for Global Security, where governments and NGOs agree that human behaviour is affecting the atmosphere. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney gives the opening address, and by the end of the event, parties agree to strive to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 20 per cent below 1988 levels by 2005. 1990: The Mulroney government releases the Green Plan, which includes $175 million for about two dozen new policies on greenhouse gas emissions, including investments in energy efficiency, alternative energy and tree planting. It sets a goal to \u201cstabilize\u201d emissions at 1990 levels by 2000. 1992: Canada signs the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Rio de Janeiro, which sets up the next three decades of global conferences to address greenhouse gas emissions. 1993: In the federal election, Liberal Leader Jean Chr\u00e9tien promises to cut emissions to 80 per cent of what they were in 1988 by 2005, the same target Mulroney agreed to in 1988. 1995: Chretien\u2019s government introduces the National Action Program on Climate Change, promising to cut 66 million tonnes of emissions from current levels in 15 years. The plan includes more than 400 possible projects or programs, such as retrofitting federal buildings, updating the national building code to identify thermal efficiencies and convincing industry to voluntarily submit climate plans. 1997: Canada agrees to the Kyoto Protocol, an extension of the UN climate framework. It sets a new target to cut emissions to six per cent below 1990 levels by 2012. 1998: The federal government introduces its new Action Plan 2000 on Climate Change to work toward its Kyoto target, with a $500-million investment over five years. It includes goals to improve vehicle fuel efficiency, investments in renewable energy and a promise to look further at using carbon capture and storage technology in the oil and gas sector. 2002: Climate Change Plan for Canada, another pathway toward the Kyoto target, talks about emissions credits trading, increased use of ethanol and biodiesel, investments in public transit and aiming to retrofit one-fifth of commercial and institutional buildings by 2010. 2005: Project Green: A Plan for Honouring our Kyoto Commitment followed the 2005 federal budget, which included more than $3 billion in climate investments, including funds to encourage wind power and other renewable energy options and tax incentives for efficient energy generation. The latest plan encourages the development of a domestic emissions credit trading system, and promises to regulate emissions from certain industries. 2007: Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper, a year after saying Canada wouldn\u2019t be able to meet the Kyoto target, sets a new goal to cut emissions to 20 per cent below 2006 levels by 2020.

Trudeau delivered the keynote address at a North American climate conference in Vancouver Tuesday, just moments after the government\u2019s new climate strategy was tabled in Ottawa. He also addressed the ongoing Russia-Ukraine crisis which has entered its 34th day with some concessions announced in talks by Russia. The prime minister is set to meet with B.C. Premier John Horgan after an announcement with Environment and Climate Change Minister Steven Guilbeault and Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson. Tuesday afternoon, he will meet with local students to again speak about the environment. That event will also see Vancouver South Liberal MP Harjit S. Sajjan in attendance.

            "full_description": "Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault today released the government's plan to dramatically curb greenhouse gas emissions over the next eight years to meet ambitious 2030 reduction targets. It's a plan that leans heavily on deep cuts in the electricity, oil and gas and transportation sectors. In an effort to slash emissions by 40 to 45 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, the federal government has announced some $9.1 billion in new investments that will, among other things, boost incentives for zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs), sweeten tax breaks for companies in the fossil fuels sector that embrace carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) technology, and work to make Canada's electricity grid cleaner. Speaking at an event in Vancouver, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the report the government's \"boldest and most specific step yet. It's ambitious and it's achievable.\" The report, titled 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan: Canada's Next Steps for Clean Air and a Strong Economy , states that the current carbon pricing regime will remain the cornerstone of the federal climate plan. The carbon price is set to rise steeply from its current level of $50 per tonne of emissions to $170 by 2030 in order to push consumers to cleaner energy sources. After years of missed targets, Liberals table their climate plan this week Trudeau calls for global carbon tax at COP26 summit Canada will put a cap on oil and gas sector emissions, Trudeau tells COP26 summit To preserve this carbon levy after the next change in government, the report said Ottawa is \"exploring legislative approaches to support a durable price on carbon pollution.\" Ottawa may also soon adopt a \"border carbon adjustment,\" which would slap tariffs on imports from jurisdictions that don't have a price of carbon, the report said. The single largest contributor of greenhouse gas emissions in Canada is the oil and gas sector. In 2019, that sector accounted for 26 per cent of national emissions, or roughly 191 megatonnes. According to the plan released Tuesday, the federal government wants to see that number reduced to just 110 megatonnes by the end of the decade. As Trudeau announced at COP26 in Glasgow last fall, the government will soon implement a hard cap on emissions \u2014 meaning that if companies want to pump out more fossil fuels in the coming decades, they'll have to do so with significantly lower emissions intensity. Ottawa goes all-in on carbon capture To accomplish such a large reduction \u2014 the government is projecting a 42 per cent cut from current levels in just eight years \u2014 Ottawa is embracing CCUS, a process that captures and reuses or stores carbon dioxide emissions. It's a technology that's already been used, with some success, in Saskatchewan and other places. The federal government said it wants to see the tech deployed more widely to reduce the emissions intensity of Alberta's oil patch and other oil-producing regions. Pumpjacks draw oil out of the ground near Olds, Alta., on July 16, 2020. (Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press) To encourage adoption of CCUS, the government said it will roll out a substantial new investment tax credit. The plan released today doesn't include any details on how such an incentive would be structured. Beyond the forthcoming tax credit, the government is urging oil and gas companies \u2014 many of them newly flush with cash thanks to rising fossil fuels prices \u2014 to plow more money into emissions reduction projects. Report calls on oilpatch to do its 'fair share' An industry that developed creative ways to extract oil from the ground is also capable of pursuing new technologies to make the whole process cleaner and greener, the report said. \"Canada's oil and gas industry is currently generating record cash flow. If deployed strategically, these funds could enhance carbon competitiveness and enable the sector to do its fair share in contributing to the country's climate goals,\" the report says. To further limit growth in the sector, the federal government said it would eliminate all \"inefficient\" fossil fuel subsidies and develop a plan to \"phase-out financing for the fossil fuel sector, including by federal Crown corporations.\" That would effectively eliminate a source of financing for companies looking to expand.

(Brittany Spencer/CBC) Because hundreds of thousands of people directly or indirectly employed in the energy sector face an uncertain future under these more constrained conditions, the federal government said it's working on a \"just transition\" plan so displaced workers \"are able to succeed in the low-carbon economy.\" Some $2 billion in federal money will be directed to new so-called \"futures funds\" in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland and Labrador to \"help workers across sectors upgrade or gain new skills to be on the leading edge of the zero carbon industry.\" The report suggested that some displaced oil and gas workers could also find jobs in emerging industries like low-carbon hydrogen. \"A hydrogen production facility utilizing carbon capture technology will not look much different from an existing refinery \u2013 and the same holds true for a biofuels plant,\" the report reads. Trudeau said \"big oil lobbyists have had their time on the field,\" and it's now \"over to workers and engineers who build solutions\" to chart a path forward for the industry. Zero-emissions vehicles The second largest source of emissions is the transportation sector. According to data from the most recent National Inventory Report, emissions from transportation were 186 megatonnes in 2018, accounting for 25 per cent of total emissions in Canada. The government wants to see that drop to 143 megatonnes by 2030. To achieve that goal, the government is proposing more aggressive action to get more people into ZEVs \u2014 zero-emissions vehicles that do not emit exhaust gas or other pollutants. The government says it will spend $1.7 billion to extend existing incentives that offer credits to people who buy zero-emissions cars and trucks. The upcoming federal budget will \"provide additional detail on the program's design,\" the report said. The government will also mandate that 20 per cent of all new light-duty vehicles sales in Canada be ZEVs by 2026 \u2014 a quick turnaround in a country where the overwhelming majority of new cars sold still have internal combustion engines. According to the market research firm IHS Markit, the ZEV share of light-duty vehicles sales in Canada was just 5.6 per cent in 2021. The federal mandate will then dictate that at least 60 per cent of all new vehicles sold in 2030 are ZEVs, before rising to 100 per cent in 2035. Under this plan, Canadians won't be able to buy a new internal combustion engine car or truck by the middle of the next decade. \"With rising consumer demand for ZEVs, and exciting new products being offered by both traditional and new manufacturers, the world is nearing a tipping point. The global electric car stock reached 10 million in 2020 and the trend line is curving upward for 2021,\" the report reads. That transition will require a dramatic expansion of the ZEV charging station infrastructure. The government is promising $400 million in new funding to help add 50,000 chargers to Canada's network. The Canada Infrastructure Bank, the federal body that supports revenue-generating infrastructure projects that are in the public interest through public-private partnerships, will also spend some $500 million on large-scale ZEV charging and refueling infrastructure. The government also wants to drive emissions reductions in medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, which have been slower to adopt zero-emission technology. The transition from gas-powered vehicles to ones that rely on electricity will result in a sizeable increase in electricity demand \u2014 and the government wants the future grid to be zero-emitting by 2035. The government says it will work with the provinces and territories to establish a \"a Pan-Canadian Grid Council\" to promote clean electricity infrastructure investments and develop emerging technologies like geothermal, tidal and small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs). For it's part, the federal government is promising to spend $850 million more then previously budgeted to help build renewable energy capacity through new wind and solar projects.",

(Shutterstock)Plastic pollution is a global problem, contaminating terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems. Microplastics \u2014 plastic particles smaller than five millimetres in size \u2014 infiltrate and circulate in the global planetary dust cycle, water cycle and carbon cycle. Microplastics have infiltrated the food and water we consume and the air we breathe. These tiny plastic particles can harm wildlife populations and communities, threatening the ecological balance. A new paper suggests plastics are a planetary boundary threat and that we are outside the safe operating space. In early March, after years of negotiations, delegates from 175 nations committed to draft the first global treaty on plastic pollution at the UN Environment Assembly in Nairobi. This resolution comes 30 years after the creation of the first global treaty to address climate change in 1992, which recognized there was a problem with greenhouse gases but did not include quantitative global targets until the Kyoto Protocol in 2005. As researchers studying plastic pollution and working at the science-policy interface, we believe there is enough evidence regarding contamination and the effects of plastic pollution to see that the first treaty on plastic needs to include quantitative targets and binding measures that facilitate a circular economy \u2014 a system that focuses on reusing and reducing plastic waste. No time to waste As with climate change, the urgency to find a solution to plastic pollution is clear. Trends show an increasing trajectory for plastic emissions \u2014 plastic emitted into the environment \u2014 just as they do for greenhouse gas emissions. In 2021, we estimated that around 30 million tonnes of plastic waste was emitted into freshwater and marine ecosystems. If we continue business as usual, that number could increase more than two-fold by the end of this decade. In 2017, we called for a global treaty to facilitate collaboration on this global issue, and in 2020 a systemic shift in the plastics economy \u2014 bending our current linear plastic economy (make-take-waste) into a circular economy (make-take-reuse), fundamentally changing the way we use plastic materials to minimize waste. A giant art sculpture showing a tap outpouring plastic bottles was erected outside the UN Environment Program headquarters in Nairobi, on March 2, 2022, during the UN Environment Assembly where delegates met to discuss a binding international framework to address the growing problem of plastic waste in the world\u2019s oceans, rivers and landscapes. (AP Photo/Brian Inganga) Our vision of an effective treaty A global treaty on plastic must have a circular economy at its core. It should also set global targets for reducing plastic emissions akin to the Paris Agreement for carbon emissions. To facilitate success, the treaty should include global mechanisms that incentivize a circular economy, methods for reporting plastic emissions at the local and national level and resources that aid economies in measuring and reducing these emissions. To measurably reduce plastic emissions, we envision a global treaty where countries sign on as signatories with a defined reduction target. For example, each country might agree to reduce 40 per cent of its emissions by 2030 from base-year levels. To facilitate a circular economy, there needs to be a global cap on virgin plastic production, recycled content standards or a shift from incentives for virgin plastic to incentives for post-consumer recycled plastic. When it comes to dealing with plastic waste, we need to switch our make-take-waste approach for a make-take-reuse one. Each country needs to come up with a strategy to meet reduction targets. Because there is no one-size-fits-all solution, each country may take on its own set of unique solutions to reach its target. For example, countries may adopt container deposit schemes to increase recycling rates, eliminate the use of single-use plastic items like plastic bags and straws that are not essential and do not fit into a circular economy, improve waste collection and management infrastructure, and agree to market only plastics that are either recyclable or reusable in their region, if not both. Each year countries must report their plastic emissions to a body like the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as part of this treaty. Determining baseline emissions, setting reduction targets and tracking our progress towards meeting those targets require formal accounting. Regular reporting of plastic emissions to the UNFCCC as part of this new treaty could help countries set reduction targets and track their progress towards meeting those targets. (Shutterstock) Here, another tool we can borrow from climate policy is the emissions inventory, which accounts for the total amount of emissions that originates from relevant sources within cities, provinces, states or countries. Emissions inventories help prioritize the reduction of emissions from the largest sources within a given region and are necessary to accurately check the effectiveness of solutions. Emissions inventories will quantify progress, identify leaders and laggards and document the success of our transition to a circular economy. For some countries, aid will be necessary to build new infrastructure for reducing plastic pollution. These countries need access to a global fund, similar to the UNFCCC\u2019s climate fund. To build this fund, an extended producer responsibility program \u2014 a materials management program funded by those who make plastics \u2014 can be implemented. For example, if a fund pulled in $0.01 for every pound of virgin plastic produced, it would have equated to $8 billion per year in 2020. Let\u2019s get to work For plastic pollution, the phrase \u201cthere is no time to waste\u201d is not just clever, it is spot on. As we negotiate how we will end plastic pollution, the problem continues to grow. We cannot wait another decade to establish baselines, reduction targets and thresholds for the safety of our environment and human health. We are optimistic about the recent resolution to draft a global treaty on plastic pollution and thrilled that Canada aims to be a leader in its creation and actions necessary to make positive change. International governments have provided an opportunity for systemic change, so let us make the most of it and develop a global treaty with quantitative targets and binding resolutions that measurably reduce our production of plastic waste and pollution.

The season 3 finale of Netflix\u2019s Snowpiercer has just landed, with Melanie Cavill (Jennifer Connelly) back in charge of the train, an abandoned mission to discover \u2018New Eden\u2019, and the big question of whether those on board will ever return to live on land. Perhaps just a warning of climate change, or maybe an allegory on social inequality, the series (along with the movie adaption from a French graphic novel series) follows 3000 survivors on board a train journeying rotations around a very icy world. The so-called \u2018Freeze\u2019 leads to the world covered over in ice, few remaining survivors, and a quest to keep those remaining alive on board an isolated train society. In the very first opening episode, we\u2019re introduced to the disastrous world that\u2019s been created as a failed attempt to solve global warming problems. Future leader of the train\u2019s society, Andre Layton (Daveed Diggs) explains: \u2018Our ice melted and all the species crashed. So the men of science tried to cool the earth, to reverse the damage they had sewn. \u2018But instead, they froze her to the core.\u2019 The only survivors left on Earth boarded \u2018The Great Ark train,\u2019 the only lasting route of survival. \u2018In the final days of The Freeze, the rich, many of them responsible, retreated to Snowpiercer, 1,001 cars long\u2026\u2019 The big freeze was a failed attempt to solve global warming (Picture: RUBA/BACKGRID) But how exactly did the world end up like that? And, as we near a global climate emergency, are we taking steps closer to becoming citizens of Snowpiercer? Snowpiercer\u2019s deep freeze follows geoengineering, which involves trying to counteract global warming by injecting particles into the stratosphere to block the sun\u2019s energy and cool the Earth. Although, as we see, this can go very, very wrong. According to Professor Duncan McLaren, a research fellow at Lancaster University, the situation of Snowpiercer is \u2018highly implausible,\u2019 despite being \u2018a useful allegory for what might happen in an extreme climate emergency of some form, whether that\u2019s through the continuation of climate change or some sort of problem trying to deal with it.\u2019 No one would have survived the icy world were it not for Mr Wilford\u2019s (Sean Bean) train (Picture: TNT) The show does however, to some extent, consider the dangers of geoengineering technologies and attempting to control global warming. Professor McLaren said: \u2018There are very genuine worries about whether we know [geoengineering technologies] well enough to control them properly, they could end up doing things we don\u2019t expect.\u2019 Dr Rob Bellamy, a presidential fellow in climate and society at the University of Manchester, added: \u2018These ideas are being considered by researchers mainly because of the fact that efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to tackle climate change are not doing so well and people are concerned that we might get to a point where we need to intervene in some other way in order to control the Earth\u2019s temperature.\u2019 Life outside the train is not as we know it\u2026 (Picture: Netflix) Whilst he agrees the situation of reaching a deep freeze state like in Snowpiercer \u2018very, very unlikely\u2019, he added that the series does highlight concerns about ongoing attempts to avoid climate change and the controversy surrounding research into geoengineering technologies. \u2018First of all, people are very wary of this idea, they\u2019re very wary of things that are seen to be tampering with nature,\u2019 Dr Bellamy added, highlighting other issues of geoengineering technologies like cost issues, and the effect on weather patterns. It\u2019s a fight for power not just a struggle to stay alive (Picture: Netflix) Power on board Snowpiercer isn\u2019t too different to real life (Picture: TNT/Netflix) While the academics therefore believe the show\u2019s link to reality is unlikely, the allegorical messages of Snowpiercer remain reflective of our real life society. Professor McLaren poignantly noted: \u2018We\u2019re never asked to question why does the train have to keep on going round and round and round, and in the world today we are never asked to question why we have to keep growing the economy bigger every time, even though it\u2019s causing climate change.\u2019 More: NetflixBridgerton: How old is John Bailey and does he have a boyfriend?Who does Anthony Bridgerton marry in Bridgerton season 2?

            "full_description": "OTTAWA\u2014The federal government has unveiled its new road map to slash greenhouse gas emissions over the next decade, charting more than $9 billion in new spending on climate initiatives and a vision to reverse and drive down rising carbon pollution from Canada\u2019s oil and gas sector. Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault tabled the plan Tuesday morning in the House of Commons. The plan is a key requirement of the government\u2019s climate \u201caccountability\u201d law that is meant to ensure Canada breaks its losing streak and finally fulfils a promise to reduce greenhouse gas pollution that causes climate change. One significant part of that will be to reduce emissions from Canada\u2019s oil and gas sector, where emissions from extraction increased about 67 per cent between 2005 and 2019, according to the most recent federal data. The Liberals have promised to implement an emissions cap on the sector, and the new plan outlines how the government expects emissions from the oil and gas industry \u2014 responsible for more than a quarter of Canada\u2019s national emissions in 2019 \u2014 to drop 42 per cent below current levels by 2030. The plan also charts expected emissions reductions from buildings, transportation, heavy industry and electricity. To help drive these reductions, the plan includes extra money for federal climate programs, including $2.2 billion for the \u201cLow Carbon Economy Fund,\u201d which finances clean energy projects, $850 millions for clean electricity projects as Canada, and $780 million for projects that conserve wetlands and other natural features that store carbon. On zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs), the plan pledges another $400 million to build more charging stations, and $1.7 billion to extend the incentive program for people who buy these cars. The Canada Infrastructure Bank is also committing to spend $500 million on ZEV infrastructure, the plan says. The government will also require that at least 20 per cent of new light-duty vehicles sold in 2026 are ZEVs, a threshold that will increase to 60 per cent in 2030 and 100 per cent in 2035. Last year, the Liberal government ditched the climate target it inherited from Stephen Harper\u2019s Conservative administration \u2014 and committed to under the international Paris Agreement in 2015 \u2014 and replaced it with a more ambitious goal of slashing emissions to at least 40 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. But Canada is a long way from that target. The latest emissions data compiled by Environment Canada shows that greenhouse gas pollution only dropped by about one per cent from 2005 to 2019. Significant declines in emissions from electricity generation, thanks in large part to the government-enforced closure of coal-fired power plants, were offset over that time by marked increases in emissions from oil and gas extraction (67 per cent) and road transportation (14 per cent), the data shows. Tuesday\u2019s new plan is meant to finally drive down annual emissions toward the 2030 goal \u2014 and break Canada\u2019s sorry losing streak on its international climate commitments. This country has failed on every promise to slash emissions it has ever made, a dismal record that the federal environment commissioner bemoaned last year as he noted Canada\u2019s roughly one-per-cent increase in emissions since the Liberals took power in 2015 is the worst performance in the G7. The plan includes an \u201cinterim objective\u201d to slash emissions by at least 20 per cent below 2005 levels by 2026, and says that measures included in the plan are projected to cut emissions by 36 per cent in 2030, with measures still under development to be designed to help close the remaining gap to at least 40 per cent that year.

            "content": "Suwin/ShutterstockAs the global population has expanded over time, agricultural modernisation has been humanity\u2019s prevailing approach to staving off famine. A variety of mechanical and chemical innovations delivered during the 1950s and 1960s represented the third agricultural revolution. The adoption of pesticides, fertilisers and high-yield crop breeds, among other measures, transformed agriculture and ensured a secure food supply for many millions of people over several decades. Concurrently, modern agriculture has emerged as a culprit of global warming, responsible for one-third of greenhouse gas emissions, namely carbon dioxide and methane. Meanwhile, inflation on the price of food is reaching an all-time high, while malnutrition is rising dramatically. Today, an estimated two billion people are afflicted by food insecurity (where having access to safe, sufficient and nutrient-rich food isn\u2019t guaranteed). Some 690 million people are undernourished. The third agricultural revolution may have run its course. And as we search for innovation to usher in a fourth agricultural revolution with urgency, all eyes are on artificial intelligence (AI). AI, which has advanced rapidly over the past two decades, encompasses a broad range of technologies capable of performing human-like cognitive processes, such as reasoning. It\u2019s trained to make these decisions based on information from vast amounts of data. Read more: Smart labels and allergy sensors \u2013 how to make sure the future of food is ethical Using AI in agriculture In assisting humans in fields and factories, AI may process, synthesise and analyse large amounts of data steadily and ceaselessly. It can outperform humans in detecting and diagnosing anomalies, such as plant diseases, and making predictions including about yield and weather. Across several agricultural tasks, AI may relieve growers from labour entirely, automating tilling (preparing the soil), planting, fertilising, monitoring and harvesting. Algorithms already regulate drip-irrigation grids, command fleets of topsoil-monitoring robots, and supervise weed-detecting rovers, self-driving tractors and combine harvesters. A fascination with the prospects of AI creates incentives to delegate it with further agency and autonomy. This technology is hailed as the way to revolutionise agriculture. The World Economic Forum, an international lobbying organisation based in Switzerland, has set AI and AI-powered agricultural robots (called \u201cagbots\u201d) at the forefront of the fourth agricultural revolution. Agricultural AI could transform the way farmers work. Hryshchyshen Serhii/Shutterstock But in deploying AI swiftly and widely, we may increase agricultural productivity at the expense of safety. In our recent paper published in Nature Machine Intelligence, we have considered the risks that could come with rolling out these advanced and autonomous technologies in agriculture. From hackers to accidents First, given these technologies are connected to the internet, criminals may try to hack them. Disrupting certain types of agbots would cause hefty damages. In the US alone, soil erosion costs US$44 billion (\u00a333.6 billion) annually. This has been a growing driver of the demand for precision agriculture, including swarm robotics, that can help farms to manage and lessen its effects. But these swarms of topsoil-monitoring robots rely on interconnected computer networks and hence are vulnerable to cyber-sabotage and shutdown. Similarly, tampering with weed-detecting rovers would let weeds loose at a considerable cost. We might also see interference with sprayers, autonomous drones or robotic harvesters, any of which could cripple cropping operations. Beyond the farm gate, with increasing digitisation and automation, entire agrifood supply chains are susceptible to malicious cyber-attacks. At least 40 malware and ransomware attacks targeting food manufacturers, processors and packagers were registered in the US in 2021. The most notable was the US$11 million ransomware attack against the world\u2019s largest meatpacker, JBS. Read more: Our food system is at risk of crossing 'environmental limits' \u2013 here's how to ease the pressure Then there are accidental risks. Before a rover is sent into the field, it\u2019s instructed by its human operator to sense certain parameters and detect particular anomalies, such as plant pests. It disregards, whether by its own mechanical limitations or by command, all other factors. The same applies to wireless sensor networks deployed in farms, designed to notice and act on particular parameters, for example, soil nitrogen content. By imprudent design, these autonomous systems might prioritise short-term crop productivity over long-term ecological integrity. To increase yields, they might apply excessive herbicides, pesticides and fertilisers to fields, which could have harmful effects on soil and waterways. Rovers and sensor networks may also malfunction, as machines occasionally do, sending commands based on erroneous data to sprayers and agrochemical dispensers. And there\u2019s the possibility we could see human error in programming the machines. There are risks associated with using AI to grow our food. rsimona/Shutterstock Safety over speed Agriculture is too vital a domain for us to allow hasty deployment of potent but insufficiently supervised and often experimental technologies. If we do, the result may be that they intensify harvests but undermine ecosystems. As we emphasise in our paper, the most effective method to treat risks is prediction and prevention. We should be careful in how we design AI for agricultural use and should involve experts from different fields in the process. For example, applied ecologists could advise on possible unintended environmental consequences of agricultural AI, such as nutrient exhaustion of topsoil, or excessive use of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilisers. Also, hardware and software prototypes should be carefully tested in supervised environments (called \u201cdigital sandboxes\u201d) before they are deployed more widely. In these spaces, ethical hackers, also known as white hackers, could look for vulnerabilities in safety and security. This precautionary approach may slightly slow down the diffusion of AI. Yet it should ensure that those machines that graduate the sandbox are sufficiently sensitive, safe and secure. Half a billion farms, global food security and a fourth agricultural revolution hang in the balance.

Some 690 million people are undernourished. The third agricultural revolution may have run its course. And as we search for innovation to usher in a fourth agricultural revolution with urgency, all eyes are on artificial intelligence (AI). AI, which has advanced rapidly over the past two decades, encompasses a broad range of technologies capable of performing human-like cognitive processes , such as reasoning. It\u2019s trained to make these decisions based on information from vast amounts of data. Read more: Smart labels and allergy sensors \u2013 how to make sure the future of food is ethical In assisting humans in fields and factories, AI may process, synthesise and analyse large amounts of data steadily and ceaselessly. It can outperform humans in detecting and diagnosing anomalies, such as plant diseases, and making predictions including about yield and weather. Across several agricultural tasks, AI may relieve growers from labour entirely, automating tilling (preparing the soil), planting, fertilising, monitoring and harvesting. Algorithms already regulate drip-irrigation grids, command fleets of topsoil-monitoring robots, and supervise weed-detecting rovers, self-driving tractors and combine harvesters . A fascination with the prospects of AI creates incentives to delegate it with further agency and autonomy. This technology is hailed as the way to revolutionise agriculture. The World Economic Forum , an international lobbying organisation based in Switzerland, has set AI and AI-powered agricultural robots (called \u201cagbots\u201d) at the forefront of the fourth agricultural revolution. But in deploying AI swiftly and widely, we may increase agricultural productivity at the expense of safety. In our recent paper published in Nature Machine Intelligence , we have considered the risks that could come with rolling out these advanced and autonomous technologies in agriculture. First, given these technologies are connected to the internet, criminals may try to hack them. Disrupting certain types of agbots would cause hefty damages. In the US alone, soil erosion costs US$44 billion (\u00a333.6 billion) annually. This has been a growing driver of the demand for precision agriculture, including swarm robotics, that can help farms to manage and lessen its effects. But these swarms of topsoil-monitoring robots rely on interconnected computer networks and hence are vulnerable to cyber-sabotage and shutdown. Similarly, tampering with weed-detecting rovers would let weeds loose at a considerable cost . We might also see interference with sprayers, autonomous drones or robotic harvesters, any of which could cripple cropping operations. Beyond the farm gate, with increasing digitisation and automation, entire agrifood supply chains are susceptible to malicious cyber-attacks. At least 40 malware and ransomware attacks targeting food manufacturers, processors and packagers were registered in the US in 2021. The most notable was the US$11 million ransomware attack against the world\u2019s largest meatpacker, JBS . Read more: Our food system is at risk of crossing 'environmental limits' \u2013 here's how to ease the pressure Then there are accidental risks. Before a rover is sent into the field, it\u2019s instructed by its human operator to sense certain parameters and detect particular anomalies, such as plant pests. It disregards, whether by its own mechanical limitations or by command, all other factors. The same applies to wireless sensor networks deployed in farms, designed to notice and act on particular parameters, for example, soil nitrogen content. By imprudent design, these autonomous systems might prioritise short-term crop productivity over long-term ecological integrity. To increase yields, they might apply excessive herbicides, pesticides and fertilisers to fields, which could have harmful effects on soil and waterways. Rovers and sensor networks may also malfunction, as machines occasionally do, sending commands based on erroneous data to sprayers and agrochemical dispensers. And there\u2019s the possibility we could see human error in programming the machines. Agriculture is too vital a domain for us to allow hasty deployment of potent but insufficiently supervised and often experimental technologies. If we do, the result may be that they intensify harvests but undermine ecosystems. As we emphasise in our paper , the most effective method to treat risks is prediction and prevention. We should be careful in how we design AI for agricultural use and should involve experts from different fields in the process. For example, applied ecologists could advise on possible unintended environmental consequences of agricultural AI, such as nutrient exhaustion of topsoil, or excessive use of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilisers. Also, hardware and software prototypes should be carefully tested in supervised environments (called \u201c digital sandboxes \u201d) before they are deployed more widely. In these spaces, ethical hackers, also known as white hackers, could look for vulnerabilities in safety and security. This precautionary approach may slightly slow down the diffusion of AI. Yet it should ensure that those machines that graduate the sandbox are sufficiently sensitive, safe and secure. Half a billion farms , global food security and a fourth agricultural revolution hang in the balance. Read more: Six big digital trends to watch in 2022",

The government\u2019s detailed, sector-by-sector roadmap for curbing emissions in the country by 40 \u2013 45 per cent of 2005 levels by the end of the decade \u2014 is now a legal requirement under a new net-zero accountability law the Liberals passed last year. The 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan \u2013 Canada\u2019s Next Steps for Clean Air and a Strong Economy is projecting that electricity emissions will be almost zero by the end of the decade but it will take longer to see real progress from the transportation sector. It announces more than 9.1 billion in new investments, which includes more than a billion dollars in efforts to move towards electric vehicles, as well as millions in support for farmers and communities to adopt cleaner practices in the journey to zero emissions. In the past, Canada has outlined 11 plans and nine different emissions targets since 1988 \u2014 none of them ever met. \u201cThe reason Canada has historically missed every single one of the emissions targets it has set for itself is not because our targets were too ambitious,\u201d Climate Action Network Canada policy manager Caroline Brouillette said. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s quite the contrary. The reason we haven\u2019t reached these targets is because of a critical lack of climate governance in Canada,\u201d she said. That is supposed to change, however, under the new accountability legislation. Related Articles: Canadians want forest protections but are concerned about jobs: survey Canada expects plan for supplying some oil to Europe ready by March 23 Tofino cutting out plastic utensils in growing pollution prevention efforts \u201cI would say the government has a critical opportunity to present a plan that fills this gap in accountable, credible, ambitious, thorough, and inclusive planning that we have not seen in Canada yet,\u201d Brouillette told CityNews. That includes timelines and clearly defining which minister is responsible for each specific emissions reduction measure. But, she says there is an \u201celephant in the room\u201d in terms of Canada\u2019s climate policy. \u201cThat is the continued expansion of the oil and gas sector. Even though we have reduced the emissions produced by every barrel of oil produced in Canada, we have expanded production. That means, over time, our emissions from that sector have increased, and today they are the largest share of our economy\u2019s emissions at 26 per cent.\u201d Brouillette believes the oil and gas industry needs to do its \u201cfair share\u201d to mitigate its greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cIf one sector doesn\u2019t do its part, the burden will fall on other sectors of the economy, other workers and other consumers.\u201d Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will be joined by Environment and Climate Minister Steven Guilbeault and Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson in Vancouver Tuesday to talk about the new plan. The prime minister is set to deliver the keynote address at the GLOBE Forum 2022. This is a developing story With files from The Canadian Press",

And eating red and processed meat can increase your risk of developing colorectal cancers. If eating less meat is good for you and the planet, then recent research has some good news: meat consumption \u2013 particularly red meat \u2013 is slowly falling in the UK. But for diet changes to really pick up the pace, it needs to be easier for everyone to make more sustainable and healthy choices. Surveys suggest that despite increasing support for the idea of eating less meat, the UK public has little appetite for interventions by the government to achieve this, whether that might be taxes, labelling or a media campaign. So what if shops and restaurants took the lead by providing more meat-free options to choose from? Would this make people more likely to eschew meat? It\u2019s not guaranteed \u2013 there are strong social influences and cultural norms that reinforce the appeal and habit of eating meat. For example, when asked why they eat meat, people often tend to describe meat as being \u201cnecessary, natural, normal and nice\u201d. Nonetheless, in three studies, my research team and I tested the effect of increasing meat-free options on the meals people choose. First, we looked at sales in a university cafeteria that changed the menu to offer two plant-based and one meat option, instead of one plant-based and two meat options, for four months. When a third of the options were meat-free, around 40% of the meals diners bought were meat-free. This rose to around 60% when two-thirds were meat-free. Making plant-based options more prominent on menus makes them seem less niche. PJjaruwan/Shutterstock In the second study, a nationwide catering company put more plant-based options on their list of meals for cafeteria managers to create their menus with. We analysed sales in 18 worksite cafeterias supplied by this company for the eight weeks before and eight weeks after the new list of meal options was available. Where there was a small increase in the number of plant-based meal options, sales of plant-based meals overall increased by a small amount, but only around half of the chefs took up the new menu options. In the third study, we recruited 2,205 UK adults to take part in an online questionnaire. We divided them into three groups, each having four main meals to choose from. Of these four options, either one, two or three were meat-free. Faced with three meat options, just 12% chose the meat-free meal, but when there were three meat-free options, 48% made that choice. Where options were equal, 28% opted for the meat-free choice. Less meat or meat-less To identify interventions that could help everyone eat less meat and not just those who already eat less than most, we looked at whether increasing meat-free options in our online study had a different effect on particular groups. Regardless of their usual meat consumption, everyone ate less meat when there were more meat-free options. This is encouraging, as it\u2019s possible to reduce meat consumption the most when everyone can cut back a bit, instead of a few people cutting back a lot or becoming vegetarian (though one person being vegan could potentially offset others taking no action). Having more meat-free meals on menus or in stores may have other benefits too. Without a wide enough range of meat-free options in shops and restaurants, other measures such as ecolabels \u2013 labelling food with its environmental impact to help people buy more sustainable products \u2013 may lose their bite. After all, how much can we expect labelling to change food choices if all the options have low ratings? We have research on this topic in the pipeline. Read more: Food and drink products with pro-environment 'ecolabels' are more appealing to shoppers \u2013 new research Making plant-based options more prominent may also begin to reverse public perceptions of meat-eating as the norm. Increasing the number of vegetarian options may signal that choosing a vegetarian meal is more commonly done by others and subconsciously nudge people to follow the trend. If just one of four options is meat-free, this could be seen as an option just for vegetarians. If half are meat-free, people have a choice of dishes which suggests plant-based food is in demand more generally, rather than being a niche choice. Of course, there is also a greater chance of there being one they would like. Plant-based meat alternatives are increasingly popular. Sheila Fitzgerald/Shutterstock Meat the deadline The National Food Strategy recommended that people in the UK eat 30% less meat by the end of the decade to reach net zero by 2050. People have ingrained habits, so it\u2019s important to find ways to help them make more sustainable food choices and to keep making them. Nearly three in four people believe it\u2019s important to buy sustainable food. Simple changes, such as providing more plant-based options in shops and restaurants, could help people to meet this goal. Adding appealing plant-based or vegetarian options to menus could get the ball rolling on the urgent changes needed, as well as enhance the impact of promising, but perhaps harder-to-implement measures, like ecolabels.

Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault will table a new greenhouse gas emissions plan in Parliament this morning. The plan is a legal requirement under the net-zero accountability law the Liberals passed last year. It will model emissions projections for different sectors that are feasible and necessary to achieve Canada's current goal to curb emissions to no more than 60 per cent of what they were in 2005 before the end of the decade. The plan was supposed to be tabled by the end of December but Guilbeault exercised a clause allowing him to ask for three more months. He says Canadians will see something in the plan they never have before: a road map to actually meet a climate target. Canada has issued at least 11 plans and set nine different emissions targets since 1988, but has never met a single one of them.",

            "content": "The ocean retains heat for much longer than land does. Aliraza Khatri's Photography via Getty ImagesGlobal warming doesn\u2019t stop on a dime. If people everywhere stopped burning fossil fuels tomorrow, stored heat would still continue to warm the atmosphere. Picture how a radiator heats a home. Water is heated by a boiler, and the hot water circulates through pipes and radiators in the house. The radiators warm up and heat the air in the room. Even after the boiler is turned off, the already heated water is still circulating through the system, heating the house. The radiators are, in fact, cooling down, but their stored heat is still warming the air in the room. This is known as committed warming. Earth similarly has ways of storing and releasing heat. Emerging research is refining scientists\u2019 understanding of how Earth\u2019s committed warming will affect the climate. Where we once thought it would take 40 years or longer for global surface air temperature to peak once humans stopped heating up the planet, research now suggests temperature could peak in closer to 10 years. But that doesn\u2019t mean the planet returns to its preindustrial climate or that we avoid disruptive effects such as sea level rise. I am a professor of climate science, and my research and teaching focus on the usability of climate knowledge by practitioners such as urban planners, public health professionals and policymakers. With a new report on mitigating climate change expected from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in early April, let\u2019s take a look at the bigger picture. How understanding of peak warming has changed Historically, the first climate models represented only the atmosphere and were greatly simplified. Over the years, scientists added oceans, land, ice sheets, chemistry and biology. Today\u2019s models can more explicitly represent the behavior of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide. That allows scientists to better separate heating due to carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from the role of heat stored in the ocean. Why global warming is ocean warming. Thinking about our radiator analogy, increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in Earth\u2019s atmosphere keep the boiler on \u2013 holding energy near the surface and raising the temperature. Heat accumulates and is stored, mostly in the oceans, which take on the role of the radiators. The heat is distributed around the world through weather and oceanic currents. The current understanding is that if all of the additional heating to the planet caused by humans was eliminated, a plausible outcome is that Earth would reach a global surface air temperature peak in closer to 10 years than 40. The previous estimate of 40 or more years has been widely used over the years, including by me. It is important to note that this is only the peak, when the temperature starts to stabilize \u2013 not the onset of rapid cooling or a reversal of climate change. I believe there is enough uncertainty to justify caution about exaggerating the significance of the new research\u2019s results. The authors applied the concept of peak warming to global surface air temperature. Global surface air temperature is, metaphorically, the temperature in the \u201croom,\u201d and is not the best measure of climate change. The concept of instantly cutting off human-caused heating is also idealized and entirely unrealistic \u2013 doing that would involve much more than just ending fossil fuel use, including widespread changes to agriculture \u2013 and it only helps illustrate how parts of the climate might behave. Even if the air temperature were to peak and stabilize, \u201ccommitted ice melting,\u201d \u201ccommitted sea level rise\u201d and numerous other land and biological trends would continue to evolve from the accumulated heat. Some of these could, in fact, cause a release of carbon dioxide and methane, especially from the Arctic and other high-latitude reservoirs that are currently frozen. For these reasons and others, it is important to consider the how far into the future studies like this one look. Oceans in the future Oceans will continue to store heat and exchange it with the atmosphere. Even if emissions stopped, the excess heat that has been accumulating in the ocean since preindustrial times would influence the climate for another 100 years or more. Because the ocean is dynamic, it has currents, and it will not simply diffuse its excess heat back into the atmosphere. There will be ups and downs as the temperature adjusts. The oceans also influence the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, because carbon dioxide is both absorbed and emitted by the oceans. Paleoclimate studies show large changes in carbon dioxide and temperature in the past, with the oceans playing an important role. The chart shows how excess heat \u2013 thermal energy \u2013 has built up in ocean, land, ice and atmosphere since 1960 and moved to greater ocean depths with time.

Palmer, James Hansen, Caterina Tassone, et al., CC BY-SA Countries aren\u2019t close to ending fossil fuel use The possibility that a policy intervention might have measurable impacts in 10 years rather than several decades could motivate more aggressive efforts to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

Instead, all of the evidence points to humanity experiencing rapid global warming in the coming decades. Our most robust finding is that the less carbon dioxide humans release, the better off humanity will be. Committed warming and human behavior point to a need to accelerate efforts both to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to this warming planet now, rather than simply talking about how much needs to happen in the future.

Karina Gould says the law would also include the principles provinces and territories signed onto in funding agreements, including cutting fees for parents and creating more spaces. Gould says her aim was to introduce a bill by this spring, but she now has until the end of the year as part of the confidence and supply agreement with the NDP. Federal officials have been quietly consulting experts on what should be in the law. The consultation document obtained by The Canadian Press says the legislation could commit to \u201congoing collaboration\u201d between the federal, provincial and territorial governments over the daycare system, including a pledge for \u201csustained federal funding.\u201d The paper also suggests annual public reports and a national advisory council could be included as part of \u201cvarious mechanisms\u201d to ensure federal accountability. \u2014 Also this \u2026 Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault will table a new greenhouse gas emissions plan in Parliament this morning.

Some members want to limit financial and other compensation to descendants of enslaved people while others say that all Black people in the U.S., regardless of lineage, suffer from systemic racism in housing, education and employment. The task force could vote on eligibility on Tuesday after putting it off last month. Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation creating the two-year reparations task force in 2020, making California the only state to move ahead with a study and plan, with a mission to study the institution of slavery and its harms and to educate the public about its findings. The committee is not even a year into its two-year process and there is no compensation plan of any kind on the table. But there is broad agreement among advocates of the need for multi-faceted remedies for related yet separate harms, such as slavery, Jim Crow laws, mass incarceration and redevelopment that resulted in displacement of Black communities. Compensation could include free college, assistance buying homes and launching businesses, and grants to churches and community organizations, advocates say. Yet, the eligibility question has dogged the group since its inaugural meeting in June, when viewers called in pleading with the nine-member group to devise targeted proposals and cash payments to make whole the descendants of people enslaved in the U.S. California Secretary of State Shirley Weber, who authored the legislation creating the task force, had argued passionately in January for prioritizing descendants for generations of forced labour, broken family ties and police terrorism. The daughter of sharecroppers forced to flee Arkansas in the dead of night, she recalled how the legacy of slavery broke her family and stunted their ability to dream of anything beyond survival. Opening up compensation to Black immigrants or even descendants of slaves from other countries would leave U.S. descendants with mere pennies, she said. \u2014 What we are watching in the rest of the world \u2026 LVIV, Ukraine _ Another round of talks aimed at stopping the war in Ukraine was scheduled for Tuesday as the fighting appeared stalemated on the ground, with the two sides trading control of a town in the east and a suburb of the capital. Ukrainian forces retook Irpin, northwest of Kyiv, from Russian troops, who were regrouping to take the area back, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said late Monday as he sought to rally the country. \u201cWe still have to fight, we have to endure,\u201d Zelenskyy said in his nighttime video address to the nation. \u201cWe can\u2019t express our emotions now. We can\u2019t raise expectations, simply so that we don\u2019t burn out.\u201d Ahead of the talks in Istanbul, the Ukrainian president said his country is prepared to declare its neutrality, as Moscow has demanded, in comments that might lend momentum to negotiations. Zelenskyy said over the weekend that compromise might be possible over \u201cthe complex issue of Donbas,\u201d the hotly contested region in the country\u2019s east. It\u2019s unclear how that might be reconciled with his stance that \u201cUkraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity are beyond doubt.\u201d Russia has long demanded that Ukraine drop any hope of joining NATO, which Moscow sees as a threat. Zelenskyy, for his part, has stressed that Ukraine needs security guarantees of its own as part of any deal. As fighting raged throughout the country, the mayor of Irpin, which has been the scene of some of the heaviest fighting, said the city had been \u201cliberated\u201d from Russian forces.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences condemned Smith striking Rock, who had made a joke about his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, and said it would launch an inquiry. Later in the day, Smith gave a stronger apology than he did in his best actor acceptance speech, which notably hadn\u2019t included an apology to Rock. \u201cViolence in all of its forms is poisonous and destructive,\u201d said Smith in a statement issued by his publicist and posted on Instagram. \u201cMy behaviour at last night\u2019s Academy Awards was unacceptable and inexcusable. Jokes at my expense are a part of the job, but a joke about Jada\u2019s medical condition was too much for me to bear and I reacted emotionally. I would like to publicly apologize to you, Chris. I was out of line and I was wrong. I am embarrassed and my actions were not indicative of the man I want to be. There is no place for violence in a world of love and kindness.\u201d The 53-year-old actor added apologies to the film academy, producers of the telecast, attendees, viewers and the Williams family. Smith was honoured Sunday for his role as Richard Williams, father of Venus and Serena, in \u201cKing Richard.\u201d \u201cI am a work in progress,\u201d added Smith.

Here is what\u2019s on the radar of our editors for the morning of March 29 \u2026 What we are watching in Canada \u2026 Canada\u2019s families minister says upcoming childcare legislation will enshrine a long-term role for the federal government in the national daycare system. Karina Gould says the law would also include the principles provinces and territories signed onto in funding agreements, including cutting fees for parents and creating more spaces. Gould says her aim was to introduce a bill by this spring, but she now has until the end of the year as part of the confidence and supply agreement with the NDP. Federal officials have been quietly consulting experts on what should be in the law. The consultation document obtained by The Canadian Press says the legislation could commit to \u201congoing collaboration\u201d between the federal, provincial and territorial governments over the daycare system, including a pledge for \u201csustained federal funding.\u201d The paper also suggests annual public reports and a national advisory council could be included as part of \u201cvarious mechanisms\u201d to ensure federal accountability. \u2014 Also this \u2026 Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault will table a new greenhouse gas emissions plan in Parliament this morning. The plan is a legal requirement under the net-zero accountability law the Liberals passed last year. It will model emissions projections for different sectors that are feasible and necessary to achieve Canada\u2019s current goal to curb emissions to no more than 60 per cent of what they were in 2005 before the end of the decade. The plan was supposed to be tabled by the end of December but Guilbeault exercised a clause allowing him to ask for three more months.

Karina Gould says the law would also include the principles provinces and territories signed onto in funding agreements, including cutting fees for parents and creating more spaces. Gould says her aim was to introduce a bill by this spring, but she now has until the end of the year as part of the confidence and supply agreement with the NDP. Federal officials have been quietly consulting experts on what should be in the law. The consultation document obtained by The Canadian Press says the legislation could commit to \u201congoing collaboration\u201d between the federal, provincial and territorial governments over the daycare system, including a pledge for \u201csustained federal funding.\u201d The paper also suggests annual public reports and a national advisory council could be included as part of \u201cvarious mechanisms\u201d to ensure federal accountability. \u2014 Also this \u2026 Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault will table a new greenhouse gas emissions plan in Parliament this morning. The plan is a legal requirement under the net-zero accountability law the Liberals passed last year. It will model emissions projections for different sectors that are feasible and necessary to achieve Canada\u2019s current goal to curb emissions to no more than 60 per cent of what they were in 2005 before the end of the decade. The plan was supposed to be tabled by the end of December but Guilbeault exercised a clause allowing him to ask for three more months. He says Canadians will see something in the plan they never have before: a road map to actually meet a climate target. Canada has issued at least 11 plans and set nine different emissions targets since 1988, but has never met a single one of them. \u2014 And this \u2026 The NDP says a promise to ban the use of replacement workers in lockouts and strikes at federally regulated workplaces is a \u201chuge win.\u201d The party\u2019s deputy labour critic, Matthew Green, says federal agreement to include the measure in a planned law was a key part of negotiating the recent confidence and supply deal with the Liberals. Unions have been calling for the change for decades \u2013 and are celebrating the news. But the Canadian Federation of Independent Business says any prolonged job action in critical federal infrastructure will hurt business owners across the country. A 2009 study shows so-called \u201canti-scab\u201d laws lead to more frequent strikes, but they aren\u2019t as long. Labour Minister Seamus O\u2019Regan says the government will be doing policy research and consultations before introducing the bill by the end of next year. \u2014 What we are watching in the U.S. \u2026 California\u2019s first-in-the-nation task force on reparations is at a crossroads, with members divided on which Black Americans should be eligible for compensation as atonement for a slave system that officially ended with the Civil War but reverberates to this day. Some members want to limit financial and other compensation to descendants of enslaved people while others say that all Black people in the U.S., regardless of lineage, suffer from systemic racism in housing, education and employment. The task force could vote on eligibility on Tuesday after putting it off last month. Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation creating the two-year reparations task force in 2020, making California the only state to move ahead with a study and plan, with a mission to study the institution of slavery and its harms and to educate the public about its findings. The committee is not even a year into its two-year process and there is no compensation plan of any kind on the table. But there is broad agreement among advocates of the need for multi-faceted remedies for related yet separate harms, such as slavery, Jim Crow laws, mass incarceration and redevelopment that resulted in displacement of Black communities. Compensation could include free college, assistance buying homes and launching businesses, and grants to churches and community organizations, advocates say. Yet, the eligibility question has dogged the group since its inaugural meeting in June, when viewers called in pleading with the nine-member group to devise targeted proposals and cash payments to make whole the descendants of people enslaved in the U.S. California Secretary of State Shirley Weber, who authored the legislation creating the task force, had argued passionately in January for prioritizing descendants for generations of forced labour, broken family ties and police terrorism. The daughter of sharecroppers forced to flee Arkansas in the dead of night, she recalled how the legacy of slavery broke her family and stunted their ability to dream of anything beyond survival. Opening up compensation to Black immigrants or even descendants of slaves from other countries would leave U.S. descendants with mere pennies, she said. \u2014 What we are watching in the rest of the world \u2026 LVIV, Ukraine _ Another round of talks aimed at stopping the war in Ukraine was scheduled for Tuesday as the fighting appeared stalemated on the ground, with the two sides trading control of a town in the east and a suburb of the capital. Ukrainian forces retook Irpin, northwest of Kyiv, from Russian troops, who were regrouping to take the area back, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said late Monday as he sought to rally the country. \u201cWe still have to fight, we have to endure,\u201d Zelenskyy said in his nighttime video address to the nation. \u201cWe can\u2019t express our emotions now. We can\u2019t raise expectations, simply so that we don\u2019t burn out.\u201d Ahead of the talks in Istanbul, the Ukrainian president said his country is prepared to declare its neutrality, as Moscow has demanded, in comments that might lend momentum to negotiations. Zelenskyy said over the weekend that compromise might be possible over \u201cthe complex issue of Donbas,\u201d the hotly contested region in the country\u2019s east. It\u2019s unclear how that might be reconciled with his stance that \u201cUkraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity are beyond doubt.\u201d Russia has long demanded that Ukraine drop any hope of joining NATO, which Moscow sees as a threat. Zelenskyy, for his part, has stressed that Ukraine needs security guarantees of its own as part of any deal. As fighting raged throughout the country, the mayor of Irpin, which has been the scene of some of the heaviest fighting, said the city had been \u201cliberated\u201d from Russian forces. A senior U.S. defence official said the U.S. believes the Ukrainians have also retaken the town of Trostyanets, south of Sumy, in the east. \u2014 On this day in 1848 \u2026 Niagara Falls stopped flowing for the only time in recorded history. The flow was blocked for 30 hours by an ice jam at the Lake Erie entrance to the Niagara River. \u2014 In entertainment \u2026 LOS ANGELES _ The day after slapping Chris Rock on the Oscars stage and upending the 94th Academy Awards, Will Smith issued an apology to the comedian, to the academy and to viewers at home, saying he was \u201cout of line\u201d and that his actions are \u201cnot indicative of the man I want to be.\u201d The fallout from Smith\u2019s actions during Sunday\u2019s ceremony continued Monday as Hollywood and the public continued to wrestle with a moment that stunned the Dolby Theatre crowd and viewers at home. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences condemned Smith striking Rock, who had made a joke about his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, and said it would launch an inquiry. Later in the day, Smith gave a stronger apology than he did in his best actor acceptance speech, which notably hadn\u2019t included an apology to Rock. \u201cViolence in all of its forms is poisonous and destructive,\u201d said Smith in a statement issued by his publicist and posted on Instagram. \u201cMy behaviour at last night\u2019s Academy Awards was unacceptable and inexcusable. Jokes at my expense are a part of the job, but a joke about Jada\u2019s medical condition was too much for me to bear and I reacted emotionally. I would like to publicly apologize to you, Chris. I was out of line and I was wrong. I am embarrassed and my actions were not indicative of the man I want to be. There is no place for violence in a world of love and kindness.\u201d The 53-year-old actor added apologies to the film academy, producers of the telecast, attendees, viewers and the Williams family. Smith was honoured Sunday for his role as Richard Williams, father of Venus and Serena, in \u201cKing Richard.\u201d \u201cI am a work in progress,\u201d added Smith. After calling a board of governors meeting Monday to discuss the incident, the film academy said that it review Smith\u2019s actions and \u201cwill explore further action and consequences in accordance with our bylaws, standards of conduct and California law.\u201d The Los Angeles Police Department said Sunday it was aware of the incident but was not pursuing an investigation because the person involved declined to file a police report. \u2014 Did you see this? Indigenous delegates who have travelled to Rome to meet with Pope Francis are to get a private tour of the Vatican Museums today. The ethnological museum includes the Vatican\u2019s collection of Indigenous artifacts, some which have not been seen publicly. Indigenous curators and experts have said they have been unable to get access to the unknown number of objects in the Roman Catholic Church\u2019s possession. M\u00e9tis National Council president Cassidy Caron says she expects not only an apology \u2014 but access to the objects. She says they are important parts of M\u00e9tis history. The Vatican says parts of its collection were gifts to popes and the Catholic Church. In 2019, the Pope committed to putting many more objects on display, including those of Indigenous people. The collection in the Anima Mundi Ethnological Museum is known to contain masks, wampum belts, pipes and rugs, as well as other items from Indigenous communities in North America. Indigenous experts have said they don\u2019t have details of the items that have been identified or any idea of how many remain unknown. Many objects were taken after the Canadian government outlawed cultural practices through the Indian Act in 1876. Ceremonial items and other important objects were seized, then sold, given to museums or destroyed. \u2014 This report by The Canadian Press was first published March 29, 2022. The Canadian Press",

            "full_description": "NEW YORK , March 29, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The tunable diode laser analyzer (TDLA) market is fragmented and the vendors are deploying organic and inorganic growth strategies to compete in the market. ABB Ltd., Advanced Holdings Ltd., AMETEK Inc., Applied Analytics Inc., BOREAL LASER INC., CEMTEK KVB-Enertec, Dimed, Endress Hauser Group Services AG, Focused Photonics Inc., Mettler Toledo International Inc., SICK AG, Siemens AG, Spectris Plc, Steam Equipments Pvt Ltd., Teledyne Analytical Instruments, TOPTICA Photonics AG, Yokogawa Electric Corp., Emerson Electric Co., Nederman Holding AB, and Sacher Lasertechnik GmbH are some of the major market participants. The tunable diode laser analyzer (TDLA) market is set to grow by USD 224.52 million from 2021 to 2026. However, the growth momentum is likely to decelerate at a CAGR of 6.8% according to the latest market report by Technavio.

Tunable Diode Laser Analyzer (TDLA) Market 2022-2026: Scope Our tunable diode laser analyzer (TDLA) market report covers the following areas: Tunable Diode Laser Analyzer (TDLA) Market size Tunable Diode Laser Analyzer (TDLA) Market trends Tunable Diode Laser Analyzer (TDLA) Market industry analysis Tunable Diode Laser Analyzer (TDLA) Market 2022-2026: Drivers & Challenges The key factors driving the global tunable diode laser analyzer (TDLA) market growth is the growing concern over greenhouse gas emissions . To reduce the emission of hazardous gases from the industrial sector, various government agencies are continuously introducing new environmental protection policies. Furthermore, these operators need to limit emissions from new and modified pneumatic pumps and from several types of equipment used at natural gas transmission compressor stations. TDLAs help to detect and measure the concentration of analyte molecules, including H2O, H2S, CO2, NH3, and C2H2, in process gas streams. NEO Monitors offers a range of LaserGas DeNOx analyzers, which can be used to measure the NH3 concentration of any type of DeNOx system and to minimize NOx emissions from refineries and power plants, especially in the chemical, petrochemical, and steel industries. Such factors will drive the market growth during the forecast period. However, the key challenge to the global tunable diode laser analyzer market growth is the growing market for rented/leased TDLA owing to the high price of TDLAs . Vendors such as BOREAL LASER, ETG Risorse, and Ashtead Technology offer TDLAs on rent or lease. The market for rented or leased equipment is gaining momentum, owing to the several advantages of taking the equipment on rent or lease over purchasing it such as cost advantages as TDLAs are highly capital-intensive equipment. In addition, the company can replace the equipment if it malfunctions, which will reduce downtime and avoid the equipment maintenance cost. Moreover, taking the required equipment on rent or lease eliminates depreciation and calibration costs. Such factors are expected to limit the growth of the global TDLA market during the forecast period. To know more about the drivers, trends, and challenges - Download a free sample now!

(Science Photo Library) Methane holds the key to finding alien life, according to new research. The powerful greenhouse gas is emitted by microbes. Most astronomers advocate looking for water and oxygen but the recently launched James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) can detect methane and is due to begin observations in the summer. The gas has been found wafting on Saturn\u2019s moons Titan and Enceladus. Co-author Dr Joshua Krissansen-Totton, of California University in Santa Cruz, said: \u2018If you detect a lot of methane on a rocky planet, you typically need a massive source to explain that. \u2018We know biological activity creates large amounts of methane on Earth, and probably did on the early Earth as well because making methane is a fairly easy thing to do metabolically.\u2019 It can be the source of methane in a rocky planet\u2019s atmosphere, the study shows. Lead author Maggie Thompson, a graduate student in the lab, said: \u2018Oxygen is often talked about as one of the best biosignatures, but it\u2019s probably going to be hard to detect with JWST.\u2019 The US team assessed the planetary conditions needed for methane to be a good biosignature. This Nasa artist\u2019s rendition shows the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in space (Credits: AFP) She said: \u2018We wanted to provide a framework for interpreting observations, so if we see a rocky planet with methane, we know what other observations are needed for it to be a persuasive biosignature.\u2019 Non-biological sources include volcanoes, ocean ridges, hydrothermal vents, tectonic subduction zones and comet or asteroid impacts. The case for methane as a biosignature stems from its instability in the atmosphere. Photochemical reactions destroy atmospheric methane. It must be steadily replenished to maintain high levels. Nonbiological sources would not be able to produce that much methane without also generating observable clues to its origins. They cannot easily produce habitable planet atmospheres rich in both methane and carbon dioxide and with little to no carbon monoxide. Outgassing from volcanoes, for example, would add both methane and carbon monoxide to the atmosphere. Biological activity tends to readily consume carbon monoxide. The study emphasises the need to consider the full planetary context. For a rocky planet orbiting a sun-like star, methane is more likely to indicate life if the atmosphere also has carbon dioxide. Ms Thompson said: \u2018One molecule is not going to give you the answer \u2013 you have to take into account the planet\u2019s full context. \u2018Methane is one piece of the puzzle, but to determine if there is life on a planet you have to consider its geochemistry, how it\u2019s interacting with its star, and the many processes that can affect a planet\u2019s atmosphere on geologic timescales.\u2019 The study considers a variety of possibilities for \u2018false positives\u2019 and provides guidelines for assessing methane biosignatures. Methane has been detected on Titan, the largest moon of Saturn (Credits: Getty) Dr Krissansen-Totton said: \u2018There are two things that could go wrong \u2013 you could misinterpret something as a biosignature and get a false positive, or you could overlook something that\u2019s a real biosignature. \u2018With this paper, we wanted to develop a framework to help avoid both of those potential errors with methane.\u2019 There is still a lot of work to be done to fully understand any future methane detections. He said: \u2018This study is focused on the most obvious false positives for methane as a biosignature. \u2018The atmospheres of rocky exoplanets are probably going to surprise us, and we will need to be cautious in our interpretations. \u2018Future work should try to anticipate and quantify more unusual mechanisms for non-biological methane production.\u2019 Titan has methane in its atmosphere and Enceladus has a liquid ocean with erupting plumes of gas and water. The study is in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

            "content": "The first Sonic the Hedgehog movie seemingly broke the video game film curse. Paramount Pictures and Sega jumped right into developing Sonic the Hedgehog 2 with Knuckles voiced by Idris Elba, Miles \u201cTails\u201d Prower joining the blue blur, and Jim Carrey\u2019s Dr. Robotnik in Green Hills. However, they\u2019re ready to go even bigger as producer Toby Ascher mentioned plans for a \u201cSonic cinematic universe.\u201d Sonic and Mario may not have been on equal footing since the 90s, but Sonic might finally be pulling away on the big screen. Knuckles the Echidna from \u2018Sonic the Hedgehog 2\u2019 trailer | Paramount Pictures \u2018Sonic the Hedgehog 2\u2019 producer Toby Ascher said Paramount and Sega planned to build a \u2018Sonic Cinematic Universe\u2019 Ascher produced the 2020 Sonic the Hedgehog, and it paid off in a huge way. The Sonic movie became the highest-grossing video game movie in US history. And now the sequel hits theaters on April 8 with the original cast returning. Ben Schwartz voices Sonic, Jim Carrey plays Dr. Robotnik. James Marsden and Tika Sumpter return as the couple taking in Sonic. Colleen O\u2019Shaughnessy voices Tails in the Sonic games and the sequel, with Idris Elba voicing Knuckles the Echidna. See footage of Jeff Fowler, James Marsden, Jim Carrey, Tika Sumpter, Ben Schwartz & Toby Ascher at Sonic the Hedgehog Family Day Event #SonicMovie https://t.co/4EZyPgrfyQ#GettyVideo#JimCarrey @fowltown @SonicMovie @Jamesmarsdenfc @JimCarrey @iamtikasumpter @rejectedjokes pic.twitter.com/7Ryj52OpXl\u2014 Getty Images Entertainment (@GettyVIP) January 25, 2020 \u201cWe\u2019re creating a Sonic cinematic universe,\u201d Ascher said in the Sonic 2 production note (via GameSpot). \u201cSo we knew we were going to add characters, like Tails and Knuckles; new to the films but beloved by gamers all over the world.\u201d While Sega plans to release Sonic Frontiers on the video game side of things, Paramount and Sega have already lined up plans for more movie sequels and spinoffs down the line. What projects are in the works for the \u2018Sonic Cinematic Universe\u2019? Before the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 release date even hit, Paramount and Sega announced a third Sonic feature film. While it is still very early for any details about Sonic the Hedgehog 3 to be floating around, fans can expect the blue blur to return to theaters again, likely with new friends. Who\u2019s counting down the days until Amy Rose or Shadow the Hedgehog debuts in cinema? Or a crossover with Nintendo\u2019s Super Mario. In addition to Sonic 3, they announced a new live-action Sonic TV show for 2023. Paramount Pictures and Sega confirmed the Paramount+ TV series would center around Knuckles. Idris Elba would return to voice the character. While the next movie and the streaming service show are the only two confirmed projects for the Sonic cinematic universe, rumors of more have already started circulating the internet. Rumors of a \u2018Sonic the Hedgehog\u2019 spinoff \u2018Tails\u2019 movie have already started Tails debuted in the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 game on the Sega Genesis. From the start, the twin-tailed fox acted as Sonic\u2019s tech-savvy sidekick. With mechanical prowess and a biplane called the Tornado, he helped Sonic fight Dr. Eggman and his various giant robots. However, one rumor states that Tails could step out on his own in a solo movie spinoff from the main Sonic the Hedgehog characters. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is even better than the 1st. The addition of Tails increases the cuteness factor while Knuckles makes a fun new villain. Jim Carrey continues to steal the show as Robotnik. I never knew how much joy a Sonic franchise would bring but here we are. #SonicMovie2 pic.twitter.com/1jQ7sxvWz6\u2014 Scott Menzel (@ScottDMenzel) March 29, 2022 However, the \u201cSonic cinematic universe\u201d has not confirmed a Tails solo project yet. Until more news drops about the blue blur\u2019s adventure on the big screen, fans can watch Sonic the Hedgehog 2 on April 8, 2022.

Spirited Away FOMO is real. With over 32 performers and over 50 puppets designed by Toby Oli\u00e9, Spirited Away looks to be an achievement in taking the whimsical world of Ghibli and translating it right on stage.

            "full_description": "IBHS gathers industry panel to discuss making affordable housing climate ready RICHBURG, S.C. , March 31, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety (IBHS) gathered affordable housing and resilience leaders for its first \"Making Affordable Housing Climate Ready\" roundtable. Participants discussed the growing importance of climate resilience for affordable housing to better prepare communities for the future. The virtual event included private and public sector representatives highlighting tools available to encourage, support, incentivize and finance resilient construction that can withstand the storms of today and tomorrow. \"To be a climate ready nation, all our buildings need to be resilient against the conditions they will face. We have the science to build our homes to better withstand severe weather. Yet, that's not always possible for individual homeowners. We must find the needed financial avenues to bring resilience into every construction project, every re-roofing project and every community,\" explains Roy Wright , president and CEO of IBHS. Following the launch of FORTIFIED Multifamily\u2122 in January, a program to bring resilience to the twenty-six percent of American households living in multifamily housing, the roundtable discussion furthered IBHS's commitment to affordable resilience as the need for climate adaptation grows. Wright opened the event by detailing the need for resilience across all types of housing to keep communities thriving for decades to come. During the event, a fireside chat featuring Wright and Pat Forbes , executive director of the Louisiana Office of Community Development (OCD), highlighted Louisiana's leadership in connecting federal and state initiatives to break the cycle of damage, disruption and displacement the state is far too familiar with after disasters. \"Many of Louisiana's most disaster-prone geographies are also where our most vulnerable populations live,\" Pat Forbes said. \"Often these populations do not have the resources to rebuild in a way that withstands the increasing frequency and severity of storms that we're seeing.\" \"This means public-funded rebuilding efforts must incorporate building standards like FORTIFIED to help protect all our residents, including those living in affordable housing, against future damage,\" Forbes said. \"For some time now, OCD has been using resilient standards for construction in its state-funded affordable housing developments, such as the resettlements at Audubon Estates, The New Isle and Les Maisons de Bayou Lafourche.\" \"The Louisiana Office of Community Development is leading the way in making communities stronger by bringing resilience to single family and multifamily housing projects across the state and setting an example of what is possible for the nation,\" added Wright. The event, moderated by Michael Newman , senior director for law and public policy at IBHS, included a panel discussion with insights from others who are leading the to charge to help ensure affordable housing is climate ready: Jennifer Landau , Senior Program Manager, Multifamily Housing Division at the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority Chris Monforton , CEO of Habitat for Humanity Mississippi Gulf Coast and Vice-Chair of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas Advisory Council Laurie Schoeman , Director, Capital Climate and Sustainability at Enterprise Community Partners Molly Simpson , Program Manager for Multifamily Green Financing Business at Fannie Mae Bringing together leaders in this space who are working to make affordable housing climate ready allows communities nationwide to better understand how to create a more resilient future and reduce the impact of severe weather.

The series introduces fans to the 26th-century conflict between humanity and an alliance of alien races called the Covenant. Two episodes of the series have now been released, allowing the show\u2019s characters to find their feet in this epic space adventure. However, following the arrival of the second chapter, Halo fans are already turning their attention to episode 3 and what the next instalment will entail.

Halo TV Series | Trailer 2 | Paramount+BridTV8115Halo TV Series | Trailer 2 | Paramount+948433948433center13872 Halo episode 2 recap [spoilers] Episode 2 of the Halo TV series exploded onto Paramount+ on Thursday, March 31st, 2022. Titled Unbound, the episode picks up from the events of episode 1 as the Master Chief and Kwan Ha Boo make their escape from the UNSC after uncovering a mysterious relic that is somehow linked to the Chief\u2019s childhood. Flashbacks show a young Chief, John-117, during his days at the facility where child Spartans are indoctrinated into the programme as he allows one of his comrades, Soren-066, to escape. Looking for answers in the present, Master Chief and Kwan arrive at a secret insurgent community that is run by none other than Soren, who introduces Chief to a man who was abducted and questioned by the Covenant and though traumatised, he helps the Master Chief learn more about the importance of the mysterious relic. The episode ends with the Master Chief blasting back off into space, leaving Kwan in the care of Soren, as he prepares to give himself up to the UNSC, as he believes humanity must know of what he has learned. Paramount+ Halo episode 3 release date and plot preview Episode 3 of the Halo series will be released on Paramount+ on Thursday, April 7th, 2022. Fans who want to watch the new episode as soon as possible will be able to do so from midnight Pacific Time in the US, which also translates to 3am Eastern Time. Unlike the opening two episodes of the series, the title of episode 3 has not been revealed ahead of its release, meaning fans will only find out the name of the episode when it hits Paramount+. After episode 2 saw Master Chief hand himself back into the UNSC, episode 3 looks set to give us the first meeting of the Chief and Cortana, the AI that Dr Catherine Halsey has been working on to help control and enhance Spartans, after the Chief explained how dire the situation was becoming. Elsewhere in episode 2, human ally to the Covenant, Makee, vowed to reclaim the mysterious relic from the UNSC, hinting that she could be about to lead an attack in the very near future, something that was teased in the series\u2019 trailers. Paramount+ How many episodes in total? Season 1 of the Halo TV series will be made up of nine episodes in total. As we\u2019ve seen with the first few chapters of the show, episodes will be released weekly on Thursdays. This means that the season will continue each week until the finale drops on May 19th. Beyond Halo\u2019s opening season, the future looks bright for the TV adaptation as a second season has already been commissioned, with the announcement coming on February 15th, more than a month before the series began.

            "full_description": "Richmond\u2019s Gateway Theatre is excited to welcome audiences back to its Mainstage for the B.C. premier of \u201cIn Wonderland\u201d, a thrilling and creative adaptation of Lewis Carroll\u2019s classic novels, \u201cAlice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland\u201d and \u201cThrough the Looking Glass\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s really exciting to be doing a show on the Mainstage again,\u201d Director of Artistic Programs Barbara Tomasic says. \u201cThe last two years have been very dour and dark and it\u2019s so celebratory to see a play again.\u201d Produced by Alberta Theatre Projects, the whimsical production of \u201cIn Wonderland,\u201d features just three actors portraying all the story\u2019s iconic characters. \u201cYou get to watch these actors changing characters to tell the story. It\u2019s seamless, theatrical, fun and playful but it\u2019s also really beautiful,\u201d Tomasic says. \u201cIt\u2019s wild for three actors to play all the characters, part of the thrill of the experience is watching the transformations take place and feeling like you\u2019re in the action.\u201d Playwright Anna Cummer was inspired to create \u201cIn Wonderland\u201d after reading Carroll\u2019s books with her children. Carroll\u2019s fantastical, whimsical world was a welcome escape for them. The story is told in the style of a variety show with everything from clown acts to musical numbers, complete with slap-stick and poetry. Each scene becomes a fast-paced vignette sure to entertain and delight both children and adults. Adding to the storybook feel are the paper props that add a tactile element to the piece. In addition, incredible projection art will transport theatre-goers to a whole different world. While the performance is based on children\u2019s books, it\u2019s a story that will resonate with all ages and can be understood and enjoyed on many different levels. \u201cIt\u2019s about family and journeying through a place you don\u2019t understand to find out who you really are,\u201d Tomasic says. \u201cIn Wonderland\u201d runs from April 7, 2022 until April 16, 2022. Taking into account patrons\u2019 varying comfort levels, Gateway Theatre has decided to limit audience capacity of all performances to accommodate physically distanced seats. The company will also be adhering to the most current health and safety guidelines established by the Province of B.C., including checking proof of vaccination upon entry and encouraging masking. Gateway Theatre will also offer a \u201cPay-What-You-Will\u201d preview performance on April 7, 2022, with tickets ranging from $5-$55. \u201cWe wanted to start making tickets accessible to people in our community. A lot of people would love to go to the theatre but it\u2019s out of their price range,\u201d Tomasic says. \u201cWe believe arts should be accessible to everyone no matter your income.\u201d \u201cIn Wonderland\u201d is also being presented in English with Traditional and Simplified Chinese surtitles, making theatre more accessible to the wider community. These initiatives support Gateway Theatre\u2019s mission to bring outstanding theatre to residents of Richmond and surrounding communities as the city\u2019s only professional theatre company. \u201cThe thing that makes us really special is that we\u2019re constantly adapting to meet the needs of the community,\u201d Tomasic says. \u201cPeople don\u2019t have to go into Vancouver to see a show. We have classes for youth and offer really diverse programming. We work really hard to find out what our neighbours want to see and try new things.\u201d Gateway Theatre also has an exciting family getaway giveaway tied to the play\u2019s premiere. Visit the company\u2019s Instagram for a chance to win four tickets to \u201cIn Wonderland\u201d and an overnight stay at Richmond\u2019s only boutique hotel, Versante Hotel, for two adults and two children.

(Picture: Getty) Takeshi\u2019s Castle, easily the most chaotic TV show ever made, is finally being given a proper reboot by Amazon Prime Video. The Japanese game show sees contestants complete a series of near-impossible physical trials set by a count, often with some pretty savage results, and ran from 1986 to 1990. It gained popularity in the UK when It was narrated by Craig Charles between 2002 and 2004 for Challenge TV, with the presenter going on to coin fans of the show \u2018Keshi heads\u2019. It was then taken over by Dick and Dom but was not well received by said Keshi heads. It\u2019s not been confirmed who will be narrating the next run of episodes but unsurprisingly fans are adamant there is only one man for the job: (Picture: Twitter) (Picture: Twitter) Love Takeshi\u2019s Castle, top notch insanity\u2026but Craig Charles has to be involved\u2014 Sue (@SueKell45037096) March 30, 2022 Takeshi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Castle needs the over-the-top commentary from Craig Charles or it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just not worth watching. https://t.co/6ziCfJscb1\u2014 Rose of Dawn (@Rose_Of_Dawn) March 30, 2022 Prime Video confirmed the reboot will be part of its upcoming slate of Japanese projects and will air to more than 240 markets in 2023, according to Deadline. The news comes after Ninja Warrior was also confirmed to be returning to ITV with a \u2018revamp\u2019, which is basically a very similar format to Takeshi\u2019s Castle but has a live audience, there\u2019s no Takeshi but there is Rochelle Humes instead so you win some you lose some. Also returning as part of Prime Video\u2019s huge Japanese slate is an adaptation of the hit anthology series Modern Love. The first two series of the American adaptation of the popular New York Times column boasted a star-studded cast including Kit Harington, Anne Hathaway, Julia Garner and Anna Paquin. Got a story?

            "full_description": "Takeshi\u2019s Castle, easily the most chaotic TV show ever made, is finally being given a proper reboot by Amazon Prime Video. The Japanese game show sees contestants complete a series of near-impossible physical trials set by a count, often with some pretty savage results, and ran from 1986 to 1990. It gained popularity in the UK when It was narrated by Craig Charles between 2002 and 2004 for Challenge TV, with the presenter going on to coin fans of the show \u2018Keshi heads\u2019. It was then taken over by Dick and Dom but was not well received by said Keshi heads. It\u2019s not been confirmed who will be narrating the next run of episodes but unsurprisingly fans are adamant there is only one man for the job: Love Takeshi\u2019s Castle, top notch insanity\u2026but Craig Charles has to be involved Takeshi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Castle needs the over-the-top commentary from Craig Charles or it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just not worth watching. https://t.co/6ziCfJscb1 Prime Video confirmed the reboot will be part of its upcoming slate of Japanese projects and will air to more than 240 markets in 2023, according to Deadline. The news comes after Ninja Warrior was also confirmed to be returning to ITV with a \u2018revamp\u2019, which is basically a very similar format to Takeshi\u2019s Castle but has a live audience, there\u2019s no Takeshi but there is Rochelle Humes instead so you win some you lose some. Also returning as part of Prime Video\u2019s huge Japanese slate is an adaptation of the hit anthology series Modern Love. The first two series of the American adaptation of the popular New York Times column boasted a star-studded cast including Kit Harington, Anne Hathaway, Julia Garner and Anna Paquin. Got a story?

This is because the anime adaptation of the Arifureta: From Commonplace to World\u2019s Strongest light novel series by Ryo Shirakome still hasn\u2019t adapted the entire story. Per Anime Geek, despite some minor chopping and changing of events throughout the most-recent broadcast, the season 2 finale is set to finish adapting the sixth volume of the light novel series. The good news is that, as of March 2022, 12 volumes have been published in Japan, meaning there is enough source material to potentially start production on Arifureta season 3 straight away! All too often in the anime industry, series are shelved because production companies need to wait for more source material to be published before they can start working on the next season. However, with there arguably being enough content straight away for another 12-episode production, this could encourage Studio Asread and Studio Mother to immediately give season 3 the greenlight. Another piece of encouragement for Arifureta season 3 would be the series\u2019 popularity. Whilst the anime has been nowhere near the top shows of the Winter slate, it\u2019s been incredibly hard for any series to get near the likes of Demon Slayer, Attack on Titan and My Dress-Up Darling. That being said, Arifureta has done a good job at maintaining its ratings with fans across its second broadcast; arguably being the \u2018best of the rest\u2019. This includes a solid, if not slightly underwhelming, 7.04/10 on MyAnimeList, 7.2/10 on IMDB and 7.7/10 on RatinGraph. Considering the availability of source material, decent performance with fans and the fact that Studio Asread hasn\u2019t publicly stated their next production; it\u2019s a safe bet that Arifureta will eventually return for season 3 \u2013 but when?

(@darkbondmage) March 24, 2022 What date could Arifureta season 3 release? Whilst the production of Arifureta season 3 has yet to be confirmed, we can make some predictions on when it could release based on the production cycle at Studio Asread. The anime adaptation was first announced in December 2017, with season 2 premiering in July 2019. The series was immediately renewed after its conclusion in October 2019, with the second broadcast beginning domestically in January 2022. This puts a rough production cycle for full TV seasons of the Arifureta anime between 18 and 26 months. At first glance, this indicates that fans may not see the series return until at least Fall 2023, if not then Winter 2024. However, the production of both seasons experienced significant delays and changes, including the replacement of Studio White Fox with Studio Mother as the secondary company for season 2. In fact, the first season was originally meant to premiere in April 2018, cutting the production cycle down to just 10 months. Under the assumption that Studio\u2019s Asread and Mother will continue the co-production with season 3, this would significantly reduce the potential wait that fans will have to endure. Considering the production cycle of previous broadcasts, as well as the availability of enough source material, fans can expect Arifureta to return in January 2023 on the Winter broadcasting slate once again.

            "content": "Mashed potatoes are important, and I take them very seriously. The epitome of comfort food, a bowl of roughed up spuds is the easiest way to turn an otherwise \u201chealthy\u201d meal into comfort food. I\u2019ve mashed a lot of potatoes a lot of different ways, but I usually employ the same two or three hacks when making them for myself and my loved ones. I\u2019ll either mash \u2018em with mayo or onion dip, and I\u2019ll often cook the spuds in the microwave, especially if I\u2019m making fewer than two pounds of potatoes. But there is another, newer mash that threatens to dethrone the mayo mash \u2014 a mash recipe that is preposterously rich and decadent, yet does not hinge on buttloads of dairy. Actually, it\u2019s barely a recipe. It\u2019s more of a manoeuvre. An addition. A hack, if you will. What I\u2019m trying to say is, you should add an egg yolk to your next batch of mashed potatoes. window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_1_mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); Egg yolk mashed potatoes are basically a more intense version of mayo mashed potatoes. (This probably sounds bad if you\u2019ve never tried mayo mashed potatoes before \u2014 go here to educate yourself.) Mayo is an emulsifier. It marries the hydrophilic with the hydrophobic, creating a smoother mash while adding a tiny bit of sweetness and tang. Mayo mashed potatoes do not taste like mayo (unless you add too much). Similarly, egg yolk mashed potatoes do not taste like egg yolks, though they certainly are yellow. They don\u2019t taste creamy. They just taste rich (almost impossibly so). They do, however, feel creamy, because egg yolks are also emulsifiers (and are, in fact, the ingredient in mayo that makes it an emulsifier). The yolk emulsifies water and fat to create a cohesive, velvety bite, while providing a little fat and body of its own. You can add an egg yolk to nearly any existing mashed potato recipe. If you are worried about the yolk flavour being too dominant, start with a ratio of one yolk for every pound and a half of potatoes. I like a more aggressive ratio, however, and do a yolk for every pound. window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_1_hpu-mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); By now you are probably looking for a quick and easy recipe to help you \u201cget\u201d the power of yolk potatoes, I I happen to have one ready for you (because my job requires it). It\u2019s a slightly adapted version of my microwave mashed potatoes, the adaptation being the addition of an egg yolk. If you want to ease your way into the richness, up the mass of potatoes to 1 1/2 pounds. Egg Yolk Mashed Potatoes About a pound of potatoes, cut into 1-inch chunks (I usually use 4 rinsed, unpeeled Yukons) 1 egg yolk 3/4 teaspoon salt (or more to taste) 2 tablespoons of butter (about 1/2 tablespoon per potato) 2 tablespoons half & half (or cream or milk) Place the potatoes in a microwave safe bowl or dish, cover with plastic wrap, and make a half-inch slit in the top. Microwave the potatoes for 9-12 minutes (depending on how many potatoes you have), until they can be easily pierced with a fork. Remove them from the microwave and roughly mash them with a large fork, a big wooden spoon, or a potato masher to let any excess moisture evaporate. You can also press them through a ricer (my preferred method). Add the butter to the hot potatoes, combine the egg yolk half & half in a separate bowl, then add the egg and dairy mixture to the potatoes, mashing and stirring quickly to ensure the egg doesn\u2019t cook into solid little bits. window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_2_mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); If you are worried about the yolk cooking the moment it hits the steaming hot potatoes, you needn\u2019t be. As long as you get to stirring fast, you shouldn\u2019t have any issues. (If you are nervous, you can also melt the butter into the half & half, then whisk little bits of the warm dairy mixture into the yolk to temper it, but it\u2019s not strictly necessary.) Serve immediately \u2014 with extra butter, if you are so inclined. The post Why You Should Add an Egg Yolk to Your Mashed Potatoes appeared first on Lifehacker Australia.",

KUALA LUMPUR, March 31 \u2014 The Employees Provident Fund\u2019s (EPF) move to completely embrace sustainable investing and reinforce its commitment to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) will benefit not only the country\u2019s capital markets but also the people, Minister of Finance Datuk Seri Tengku Zafrul Aziz said.The EFP is Malaysia\u2019s largest institutional investor and pension fund.Driven by its commitment to two overarching sustainable investment goals of ESG compliance by 2030 and a climate-neutral portfolio by 2050, the EPF\u2019s Sustainable Investment Policy, Priority Issues Policies, and Priority Sector Policies are all steps in the right direction for its sustainable investment ambitions.This is in addition to laying the foundations for more climate-resilient and socially responsible practices, as well as sound corporate governance, among its investee companies.\u201cThe government believes that by institutionalising ESG policies in EPF\u2019s investments, the benefits will cascade down the value chain of Malaysia\u2019s capital markets, ultimately benefitting the Rakyat,\u201d he said.In fact, today\u2019s pledges by all 16 of the EPF\u2019s external fund managers to incorporate ESG considerations into their investment decision-making and to collaborate with the EPF to promote the ESG agenda serve as a great starting point, the finance minister said at the launch of the EPF\u2019s sustainable investment policy.However, while the strive is for higher standards by aligning policies with global standards or frameworks, its principles and approach must be tailored to national objectives, as well as local needs and requirements, he warned. This, he said is to ensure a fair and equitable transition that recognises each country\u2019s unique characteristics, strengths and challenges in achieving those objectives.ESG and labour standardsFurthermore, as global scrutiny on labour standards gradually increases, the government is confident that the EPF\u2019s workers\u2019 wellbeing policy will further strengthen labour practices among Malaysian corporates, while also serving as a testament to the country\u2019s commitment to strive for better workers\u2019 wellbeing.On the social front, Malaysia is facing increased scrutiny of its labour practices, particularly the treatment of foreign labour by corporate Malaysia.Tengku Zafrul said these issues have a tangible adverse impact not only on business profitability but also on the nation\u2019s reputation as a whole. \u201cAs a result, it is undeniable that sustainable or ESG investing is becoming increasingly important, and is no longer limited to developed countries.\u201dAccording to Bloomberg Intelligence, global ESG assets are on track to exceed US$53 trillion (RM222 trillion) by 2025, accounting for more than a third of the projected total assets under management of US$140.5 trillion.The rush into ESG assets is unsurprising given their expected long-term outperformance. On an annualised three, five, and 10- year returns, for example, the MSCI Malaysia ESG Leaders index clearly outperformed the MSCI Malaysia Index.In other developments, Tengku Zafrul said the Ministry of Finance (MOF) has already begun budget-tagging specific measures to ensure that various ministries spend in accordance with their sustainability expectations.\u201cTo maintain the momentum of this mainstreaming process, institutional investors must share key data on how each industry in their ecosystem has \u2018shaped up\u2019 in terms of sustainability,\u201d he added.This will enable future policies to be tweaked accordingly to improve Malaysia\u2019s climate adaptation and crisis mitigation strategies as quickly as possible. \u2014 Bernama",

            "full_description": "The Employees Provident Fund (EPF) logo is seen at its headquarters on Jalan Raja Laut January 22, 2020. \u2014 Picture by Hari Anggara Follow us on Instagram and subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates. KUALA LUMPUR, March 31 \u2014 The Employees Provident Fund\u2019s (EPF) move to completely embrace sustainable investing and reinforce its commitment to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) will benefit not only the country\u2019s capital markets but also the people, Minister of Finance Datuk Seri Tengku Zafrul Aziz said. The EFP is Malaysia\u2019s largest institutional investor and pension fund. Driven by its commitment to two overarching sustainable investment goals of ESG compliance by 2030 and a climate-neutral portfolio by 2050, the EPF\u2019s Sustainable Investment Policy, Priority Issues Policies, and Priority Sector Policies are all steps in the right direction for its sustainable investment ambitions. This is in addition to laying the foundations for more climate-resilient and socially responsible practices, as well as sound corporate governance, among its investee companies. \u201cThe government believes that by institutionalising ESG policies in EPF\u2019s investments, the benefits will cascade down the value chain of Malaysia\u2019s capital markets, ultimately benefitting the Rakyat,\u201d he said. In fact, today\u2019s pledges by all 16 of the EPF\u2019s external fund managers to incorporate ESG considerations into their investment decision-making and to collaborate with the EPF to promote the ESG agenda serve as a great starting point, the finance minister said at the launch of the EPF\u2019s sustainable investment policy. However, while the strive is for higher standards by aligning policies with global standards or frameworks, its principles and approach must be tailored to national objectives, as well as local needs and requirements, he warned. This, he said is to ensure a fair and equitable transition that recognises each country\u2019s unique characteristics, strengths and challenges in achieving those objectives. ESG and labour standards Furthermore, as global scrutiny on labour standards gradually increases, the government is confident that the EPF\u2019s workers\u2019 wellbeing policy will further strengthen labour practices among Malaysian corporates, while also serving as a testament to the country\u2019s commitment to strive for better workers\u2019 wellbeing. On the social front, Malaysia is facing increased scrutiny of its labour practices, particularly the treatment of foreign labour by corporate Malaysia. Tengku Zafrul said these issues have a tangible adverse impact not only on business profitability but also on the nation\u2019s reputation as a whole. \u201cAs a result, it is undeniable that sustainable or ESG investing is becoming increasingly important, and is no longer limited to developed countries.\u201d According to Bloomberg Intelligence, global ESG assets are on track to exceed US$53 trillion (RM222 trillion) by 2025, accounting for more than a third of the projected total assets under management of US$140.5 trillion. The rush into ESG assets is unsurprising given their expected long-term outperformance. On an annualised three, five, and 10- year returns, for example, the MSCI Malaysia ESG Leaders index clearly outperformed the MSCI Malaysia Index. In other developments, Tengku Zafrul said the Ministry of Finance (MOF) has already begun budget-tagging specific measures to ensure that various ministries spend in accordance with their sustainability expectations. \u201cTo maintain the momentum of this mainstreaming process, institutional investors must share key data on how each industry in their ecosystem has \u2018shaped up\u2019 in terms of sustainability,\u201d he added. This will enable future policies to be tweaked accordingly to improve Malaysia\u2019s climate adaptation and crisis mitigation strategies as quickly as possible. \u2014 Bernama",

As reported by Variety , Purnell will be taking on a currently unspecified lead role in the upcoming series. However, sources close to the show have revealed Purnell's character will be \"upbeat and uncannily direct with an all-American can-do spirit. \"But an intensity in her eyes says she might just be a tiny bit dangerous.\" Watch on YouTube Along with her aforementioned work, Purnell has also had roles in Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, Disney's Maleficent and Kick-Ass 2. Purnell's casting follows the announcement that Tomb Raider and The Hateful Eight's Walton Goggins will also be starring in Fallout . As with Purnell, no official details about Goggins' character have yet been revealed, although there is speculation he will be playing a Ghoul - one of the Fallout series' many mutated humans, whose condition is a result of prolonged exposure to radiation amid the Great War. It was first announced that Amazon would be adapting Fallout for TV all the way back in 2020. Westworld series creators Lisa Joy and Jonah Nolan will oversee the project (Amazon signed a five-year deal with the duo's Kilter Films to produce new shows for its Prime Video streaming service last year), while Bethesda's Todd Howard and James Altman will take on executive producer roles. Filming is expecting to start later this year, with more cast announcements likely to come before that. Will you support Eurogamer?

            "description": "Prime Video has cast the lead role in its Fallout TV adaptation \u2013 and it's a casting that Army of the Dead fans will love.",
            "full_description": "Army of the Dead star Ella Purnell has reportedly joined the cast of Prime Video's upcoming Fallout TV show. Per Deadline , Purnell \u2013 who also stars in Netflix's Arcane animated series and Showtime's Yellowjackets \u2013 has landed one of the lead roles in the Fallout TV series. Unsurprisingly, there are few confirmed details about who Purnell will play. However, Deadline suggests the Army of the Dead actor will portray someone called Jean, a \"young woman with a can-do attitude\" who'll be hiding a dark secret when the series begins. Purnell will line up alongside Walton Goggins (Justified, Invincible ), who signed onto the Prime Video show project in February 2022 (per The Hollywood Reporter ). Goggins is expected to play another of the series' main characters, but there's no word on who he'll play yet. Prime Video's live-action adaptation of Bethesda's beloved post-apocalyptic RPG series has been in development since 2020, but is slated to enter full production sometime in 2022. Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, the brainchilds behind fan favorite sci-fi series Westworld and the Hugh Jackman-starring movie Reminiscence , will reportedly pen the scripts and take on executive producing roles. The duo will be joined by Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Graham Wagner, who will serve as showrunners. Meanwhile, Bethesda Game Studios director Todd Howard is also on board as an executive producer alongside James Altman, Bethesda Softworks' director of publishing. Fallout has been a wildly popular series among gamers since the first title launched in October 1997. The critically-acclaimed franchise puts players in the shoes of a post-nuclear war survivor \u2013 known as a Vault inhabitant \u2013 who must venture out of their shelter, head into the wastelands to complete various tasks, explore the post-apocalyptic world, and more. Bethesda's game series currently comprises nine titles, with action-RPG MMO Fallout 76 the latest to be released. Fallout 76 is set to receive its next major update sometime in late 2022 . It's a possibility. The Fallout game series is rich in lore, interesting characters, real-world settings, and \u2013 though it's been done countless times before \u2013 sits squarely in the popular post-apocalyptic genre. Add in two well-known actors in Goggins and Purnell, and Prime Video's Fallout adaptation has the ingredients to be a good TV series. Of course, it'll take the show's proverbial chefs to cook up a good meal \u2013 i.e. a well-received TV adaptation \u2013 using those raw materials. Many have tried (and failed) to create a worthy movie or TV adaptation of a beloved video game series. There have been some successes recently \u2013 Pok\u00e9mon: Detective Pikachu, Sonic the Hedgehog, Mortal Kombat , Arcane, and The Witcher to name five \u2013 but, largely, video games don't translate well to the big or small screens. Just look at The Rock's Doom film, Michael Fassbender's Assassin's Creed movie, or one of Sonic 's many animated TV shows. Still, Amazon Studios will need Prime Video's Fallout adaptation to do well. Amazon is also reportedly developing a God of War TV show , based on Sony Santa Monica's iconic game series, so its Fallout live-action show will need to show whether there's an audience for this kind of content. If not, Prime Video can always fall back on its fantasy shows, such as The Wheel of Time and The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power , or fan favorite R-rated superhero programs like The Boys . Meanwhile, there are plenty of other video game franchises that are being turned, or have been turned, into TV shows that gamers and general audiences to potentially enjoy. HBO is developing a Last of Us show based on Naughty Dog's acclaimed gaming series, while Netflix has a Resident Evil TV show on the way. Finally, the long-gestating Halo show just started streaming on Paramount Plus , but we think it has an identity problem .",

            "full_description": "Sundance Now has dropped the first trailer for Ten Percent , the UK remake of hit French comedy Call My Agent! in what looks to be a fairly faithful and quite fun adaptation. Sundance Now and AMC+ will premiere the first two episodes on April 29 in the U.S., with the rest of the season following weekly. Amazon has UK rights and is due to launch this spring. From W1A \u2019s John Morton, Bron Studios and Headline Pictures, Ten Percent follows the small London talent agency of Nightingale Hart as it struggles to adapt in an ever-changing industry. After tragedy strikes the company, the personal and professional lives of the agents and assistants are thrown into turmoil. But their celebrity clients are in constant need of help, with issues ranging from marital problems to over-commitment to lingering method acting to stage fright. As the agents deal with the incessant demands of their jobs, they\u2019ll also find themselves dealing with more off-screen drama than they ever expected. The series stars Jack Davenport , Lydia Leonard, Maggie Steed, Prasanna Puwanarajah, Chelsey Crisp, Hiftu Quasem, Fola Evans-Akingbola, Rebecca Humphries, Harry Trevaldwyn, Tim McInnerny, Natasha Little, Edward Bluemel, Eleonore Arnaud and Jim Broadbent. Among the starry cameos teased in the trailer and more promised for the upcoming series are Helena Bonham Carter , Dominic West , David Oyelowo, Kelly Macdonald, Olivia Williams, Phoebe Dynevor, Jessica Oyelowo, Emma Corrin, Himesh Patel, Clemence Poesy and David Harewood. An Amazon premiere date for the UK is still to be confirmed. In the U.S., following the initial broadcast of the first two episodes, BBC America will run an encore airing of the first ep on May 1 and continue to drop new episodes weekly thereafter.",

            "content": "It\u2019s no secret that Aussie author Aaron Blabey\u2019s series of children\u2019s books, The Bad Guys, has been a huge success. The books, which follow the adventures of a group of animal criminals, have sold over 30 million copies worldwide. They should really really think about renaming it to \u2018The Big Guys\u2019 at this point. It seems like a no-brainer then that a Hollywood studio would snap up the rights to make a film version. But from the author\u2019s point of view, how exactly does that happen? Aaron Blabey told Gizmodo Australia in a video interview that after The Bad Guys took off in schools overseas, the Hollywood studios came calling. \u201cI went across and met with all the studios at the end of 2016 and a number of them were pursuing the series,\u201d Blabey explained. But it was Dreamworks that stood out. \u201cWe just found ourselves drifting back each time to Dreamworks because they just had the best feel for it. Their sense of the tone and spirit of the books, my sense of humour and the characters, they were almost reverent towards it.\u201d The author said Dreamworks\u2019 respect for the source material was comforting, particularly after so many book-to-movie adaptations have gone wrong. window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_1_mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); \u201cAs a lifelong movie fan, I\u2019m acutely aware of how quickly an adaptation can go off the rails and how often people, especially authors, are deeply disappointed in an adaptation of their book. So that was my worst nightmare, really,\u201d Blabey said. \u201cBut we just had a gut feeling from the beginning that Dreamworks was the right home.\u201d And so began the process of turning hand-drawn pages into big-screen animation. Image: Universal Pictures Pierre Perifel was hired to direct The Bad Guys and Etan Cohen and Hilary Winston penned the movie\u2019s script, but Blabey remained on board as an executive producer which gave him a fair amount of oversight. \u201cIt allowed me to be across every draft of the script, every cut of the movie and then contribute thoughts and notes on everything that I loved and everything that I didn\u2019t love so much,\u201d Blabey said. The author\u2019s notes on a project are something that could be ignored but Blabey said in the case of The Bad Guys they never were. \u201cFrom the beginning, everything that I have ever written down or mentioned to them has been considered or incorporated. Or they\u2019ve shown me an alternative that\u2019s been better than something I\u2019ve suggested,\u201d he said. Keeping the spirit of the books alive in the movie was incredibly important to Blabey, who has often been referred to as \u201cTarantino for children\u201d. That being said, there\u2019s something in there for adults as well. window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_1_hpu-mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); \u201cIt lands in that spot where adults and children can simultaneously have a really great time,\u201d Blabey said. The story of The Bad Guys in the movie sticks pretty closely to that of the books. Mr Wolf, Mr Shark, Mr Snake, Mr Piranha and Ms Tarantula have always been seen as the bad guys. So, they decide to lean into that stereotype and form a criminal gang pulling heists across the city. But in order to save themselves from prison time they have to promise to become the good guys, which proves to be a challenge for some more than others. Blabey said he was pleased by how faithful The Bad Guys movie is to the first four books in his series. However, he wasn\u2019t afraid to let the film move in its own direction. \u201cBecause it\u2019s a movie and it\u2019s a different format, they wanted to push through with that Soderbergh kind of heist tone, and that was obviously right in my wheelhouse as well,\u201d Blabey said. \u201cSo I couldn\u2019t have been more thrilled when it went in that direction.\u201d It\u2019s easy to see that faithful transition from book to movie in The Bad Guys\u2019 trailers alone, which show off a heist story full of heart and humour. Pair that with a killer voice cast, that includes the likes of Sam Rockwell and Awkwafina, and a slick animation style, The Bad Guys seems poised to be a new animated favourite. Image: Universal Pictures window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_2_mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); That unique animation style, which brings Blabey\u2019s sketches to life, was something the author was particularly blown away by. \u201cI am an extremely limited draftsman,\u201d Blabey explained. \u201cThe books are a testament so someone working right at the limit of their talent.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s been a joy is watching a team, who massively know what they\u2019re doing in that department, just take it and fly into this amazing world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are elements of [CGI], but there\u2019s also elements of 2D and anime and all kinds of other stuff mashed in there, which I think has made it feel really fresh.\u201d Comparisons between the animation styles of The Bad Guys and the award-winning Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse have already been made, which is a huge testament to the film before its release. \u201cIt looked edible to me. You just want to munch on it,\u201d Blabey said. Now, The Bad Guys\u2019 release date is imminent which brings an end to a multi-year journey (often done over Zoom) for Blabey. Luckily, it\u2019s been a fruitful one and the author has come away feeling extremely proud of the film adaptation. \u201cThere\u2019s not a single frame of this film that I\u2019m not entirely behind,\u201d the author said. The Bad Guys will released in Australian cinemas today, March 31. The post How The Bad Guys Author Aaron Blabey Turned His Books Into a Big Screen Success appeared first on Gizmodo Australia.",

            "full_description": "It\u2019s no secret that Aussie author Aaron Blabey\u2019s series of children\u2019s books , The Bad Guys , has been a huge success. The books, which follow the adventures of a group of animal criminals, have sold over 30 million copies worldwide. They should really really think about renaming it to \u2018The Big Guys\u2019 at this point. It seems like a no-brainer then that a Hollywood studio would snap up the rights to make a film version. But from the author\u2019s point of view, how exactly does that happen? Aaron Blabey told Gizmodo Australia in a video interview that after The Bad Guys took off in schools overseas, the Hollywood studios came calling. \u201cI went across and met with all the studios at the end of 2016 and a number of them were pursuing the series,\u201d Blabey explained. But it was Dreamworks that stood out. \u201cWe just found ourselves drifting back each time to Dreamworks because they just had the best feel for it. Their sense of the tone and spirit of the books, my sense of humour and the characters, they were almost reverent towards it.\u201d The author said Dreamworks\u2019 respect for the source material was comforting, particularly after so many book-to-movie adaptations have gone wrong. \u201cAs a lifelong movie fan, I\u2019m acutely aware of how quickly an adaptation can go off the rails and how often people, especially authors, are deeply disappointed in an adaptation of their book. So that was my worst nightmare, really,\u201d Blabey said. \u201cBut we just had a gut feeling from the beginning that Dreamworks was the right home.\u201d And so began the process of turning hand-drawn pages into big-screen animation. Image: Universal Pictures Pierre Perifel was hired to direct The Bad Guys and Etan Cohen and Hilary Winston penned the movie\u2019s script, but Blabey remained on board as an executive producer which gave him a fair amount of oversight. \u201cIt allowed me to be across every draft of the script, every cut of the movie and then contribute thoughts and notes on everything that I loved and everything that I didn\u2019t love so much,\u201d Blabey said. The author\u2019s notes on a project are something that could be ignored but Blabey said in the case of The Bad Guys they never were. \u201cFrom the beginning, everything that I have ever written down or mentioned to them has been considered or incorporated. Or they\u2019ve shown me an alternative that\u2019s been better than something I\u2019ve suggested,\u201d he said. Keeping the spirit of the books alive in the movie was incredibly important to Blabey, who has often been referred to as \u201cTarantino for children\u201d. That being said, there\u2019s something in there for adults as well. \u201cIt lands in that spot where adults and children can simultaneously have a really great time,\u201d Blabey said. The story of The Bad Guys in the movie sticks pretty closely to that of the books. Mr Wolf, Mr Shark, Mr Snake, Mr Piranha and Ms Tarantula have always been seen as the bad guys. So, they decide to lean into that stereotype and form a criminal gang pulling heists across the city. But in order to save themselves from prison time they have to promise to become the good guys, which proves to be a challenge for some more than others. Blabey said he was pleased by how faithful The Bad Guys movie is to the first four books in his series. However, he wasn\u2019t afraid to let the film move in its own direction. \u201cBecause it\u2019s a movie and it\u2019s a different format, they wanted to push through with that Soderbergh kind of heist tone, and that was obviously right in my wheelhouse as well,\u201d Blabey said. \u201cSo I couldn\u2019t have been more thrilled when it went in that direction.\u201d It\u2019s easy to see that faithful transition from book to movie in The Bad Guys\u2019 trailers alone, which show off a heist story full of heart and humour. Pair that with a killer voice cast, that includes the likes of Sam Rockwell and Awkwafina, and a slick animation style, The Bad Guys seems poised to be a new animated favourite. Image: Universal Pictures That unique animation style, which brings Blabey\u2019s sketches to life, was something the author was particularly blown away by. \u201cI am an extremely limited draftsman,\u201d Blabey explained. \u201cThe books are a testament so someone working right at the limit of their talent.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s been a joy is watching a team, who massively know what they\u2019re doing in that department, just take it and fly into this amazing world,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are elements of [CGI], but there\u2019s also elements of 2D and anime and all kinds of other stuff mashed in there, which I think has made it feel really fresh.\u201d Comparisons between the animation styles of The Bad Guys and the award-winning Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse have already been made, which is a huge testament to the film before its release. \u201cIt looked edible to me. You just want to munch on it,\u201d Blabey said. Now, The Bad Guys\u2019 release date is imminent which brings an end to a multi-year journey (often done over Zoom) for Blabey. Luckily, it\u2019s been a fruitful one and the author has come away feeling extremely proud of the film adaptation. \u201cThere\u2019s not a single frame of this film that I\u2019m not entirely behind,\u201d the author said. The Bad Guys will released in Australian cinemas today, March 31.",

With a slated release date of 2021, it was first announced that the show would appear on Showtime, with Steven Spielberg serving as executive producer, undergoing development for four years. After multiple changes behind the scenes over the last few years \u2014 including directors, producers and writers, and production setbacks due to the pandemic \u2014 the show has finally arrived on Paramount+, with a massive lineup of pros behind the production. While video game to small screen adaptations have caused some dicey discourse amongst fanbases in the past, fans of the classic Xbox series can rejoice that the series has opened to positive reviews from both die-hard fans of the game and your average sci-fi viewer. The show has already been renewed for season two, which is definitely telling of stakeholders\u2019 faith in the show\u2019s ability to appease long-time fans and appeal to newcomers. Given the Halo franchise had sold over 82 million copies worldwide since its first release in 2001 when the trailer for the show first dropped in late 2021, the internet was set ablaze with commentary, with fans pondering how the epic game would shine as a TV show. So, if you\u2019re ready to dive into the series (and make your own mind up), here\u2019s everything you need to know.

The final episode will arrive on May 19 if you\u2019re looking to avoid all spoilers and binge the show in its entirety once released in full. You can sign up and check out the Halo premiere for free and then continue with Paramount+\u2019s monthly $8.99 fee to watch the remainder of the show. Paramount+ also features other titles like Yellowjackets, Star Trek: Discovery and The Gilded Age, so you\u2019ll be getting bang for your buck. What\u2019s The Main Storyline & Who\u2019s In The Cast? Halo features Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief, Natascha McElhone as his war criminal mother, Dr Halsey and Charlie Murphy as Makee, a human who has been raised by the Covenant (whose perspective the show will also feature). The first series will follow Master Chief and his comrades as they attempt to stop an alliance of aliens known as the Covenant from wiping out humanity. The series takes place in the \u2018Silver Timeline\u2019 \u2014 a new yet similar version of the Halo universe that already exists in the games and novels. 343 Industries released a blog post addressed to fans explaining that the timeline had been created as a way for the creators to craft a unique story that didn\u2019t adhere precisely to events that had already taken place in the Halo universe. Who\u2019s Behind The Show? While Steven Spielberg didn\u2019t exactly make creative decisions, Darryl Frank, at the Winter 2022 TCA presentation, said Speilberg \u201cgodfathered\u201d the series, as he helped steer much of the team across a lengthy development process. window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_1_hpu-mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); While multiple changes were made to the writing team during the show\u2019s development, Kyle Killen and Steven Kane \u2014 who\u2019ve worked across shows like Alias, Lone Star and Awake \u2014 were behind the screenwriting of season one. In addition, the initial episodes of season one were directed by Otto Bathurst, who\u2019s previously worked on Black Mirror, Peaky Blinders and Robin Hood. What Are Critics Saying About It So Far? A quick scroll through Twitter will show that fans are praising the show\u2019s faithfulness to the game\u2019s main plot, the epic graphic work and production design, as well as stellar performances from the cast. However, given there is only one episode out currently, many are curious about how the show will continue to incorporate other elements of Halo lore. The press has also praised the show for similar reasons, with some noting how the show has taken the Halo universe fans know and love in a new direction \u2014 a sentiment echoed by IGN\u2019s Jesse Schedeen. \u201cAs much as the premiere focuses on capturing the iconic weapons and technology from the games, it also shows a willingness to move its story in dramatically different directions. This is hardly a 1:1 adaptation of the games, and that\u2019s really the show\u2019s biggest selling point right now.\u201d window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_2_mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); Loved #HaloTheSeries \u2013 I\u2019m a complete newbie to the franchise as I\u2019m not a gamer, so as a sci-fi action series it\u2019s giving me everything I want so far!

She encouraged him to go forth with his plan to die. Now, in 2022, Colton Ryan joined The Girl From Plainville cast to depict Roy. And he even visited the spot where Roy died. Colton Ryan joined \u2018The Girl From Plainville\u2019 cast as Conrad Roy III Colton Ryan as Conrad Roy | Steve Dietl/Hulu The Girl From Plainville depicts what happened between Michelle Carter and Conrad Roy III leading up to his death. So, how did Conrad Roy die? He died by suicide after inhaling carbon monoxide fumes in a parked truck. Prior to joining The Girl From Plainville cast, Colton Ryan played Connor Murphy in both the Broadway production and movie adaptation of Dear Evan Hansen. Dear Evan Hansen told the story of a young student who pretended to have a close relationship with a deceased student to get close to his family. \u201cI think you can already imagine what that phone call to my mother was like,\u201d Ryan told Variety. \u201cShe sort of like, \u2018Should I know something? Do I need to be worried?\u2019 And I asked myself that same question. It\u2019s just an introspective thing you start thinking, like, what is it about me that I bring to this dark place?\u201d Colton Ryan visited the Kmart parking lot where Conrad Roy died Elle Fanning as Michelle Carter | Steve Dietl/Hulu After joining The Girl From Plainville cast, Colton Ryan did his research on Conrad Roy. According to Variety, Ryan spoke to a member of the Roy family while prepping for his role. He didn\u2019t elaborate on the experience. He also traveled to Fairhaven, Massachusetts, where Roy lived. Ryan went to the Kmart parking lot where Roy parked the truck and died as well. \u201cIt felt really like, sort of symbolic,\u201d Ryan explained. \u201cIt\u2019s dark, but the Kmart that is featured so much, it\u2019s gone. Kmarts are gone. There is a finish to it. There\u2019s a Tractor Supply Store now. I sat there and tried to open myself up.\u201d MassLive rehashes the texts between Roy and Michelle Carter where Carter encourages Roy to go driving in his truck to die by suicide. \u201cJust go somewhere in your truck and no one is really out there right now because it\u2019s an awkward time,\u201d Carter texted him. \u201cIf you don\u2019t do it now you\u2019re never gonna do it, and you can say you\u2019ll do it tomorrow but you probably won\u2019t.\u201d \u2018The Girl From Plainville\u2019 cast wanted to remain sensitive to Michelle Carter and Conrad Roy\u2019s text exchanges Elle Fanning as Michelle Carter and Colton Ryan as Conrad Roy | Steve Dietl/Hulu While Michelle Carter and Conrad Roy\u2019s text exchanges are public, The Girl From Plainville cast wanted to remain sensitive to the content. \u201cIt ultimately ends in such a tragedy, and these [families] are still alive, and we have to be sensitive to them,\u201d Elle Fanning told Entertainment Weekly. \u201cSo it had to be told in the right way that could actually be helpful, and possibly help someone out there who\u2019s suffering, while not trying to sensationalize suicide, like a lot of shows do.\u201d \u201cAs an actor, those texts are bible,\u201d Colton Ryan added. \u201cThere\u2019s no subtext in texting, as I learned. There\u2019s only the way you receive it because texting is a lot of id. \u2026 \u00a0And working with Elle on those, I think we both felt a similar thrill because this is a very grounded, naturalistic show that also has all these fantasy sequences that, quite honestly, I think the heightened parts, the fantasy, are the more honest insights into Michelle and Coco.\u201d How to get help:\u00a0In the U.S., call the\u00a0National Suicide Prevention Lifeline\u00a0at 1-800-273-8255.

            "content": "EDMONTON, AB \u2013 New proposed legislation from the provincial government aims to help finance and fintech companies develop new products and services in Alberta. If passed, Bill 13, known as the Financial Innovation Act, will create a regulatory sandbox for financial services and fintech companies. A fintech company refers to a company specializing in financial technology. Regulatory sandboxes offer businesses temporary relief from certain legislative and regulatory requirements, making it simpler for them to test new products and services while expanding their offerings to consumers. The sandbox would be the first of its kind in the country, which the province says will incentivize businesses to set up shop in Alberta. Travis Toews, President of the Treasury Board and Alberta\u2019s Minister of Finance said, \u201cthe world of finance is rapidly evolving, and our government understands that we need to partner with businesses if Alberta is going to stay ahead of the curve.\u201d \u201cCutting red tape and making it easier to do business in Alberta is a crucial part of our strategy to grow the economy, support job creation and make Alberta the best place to live, work and raise a family.\u201d The province explained that generally, before companies can start to begin offering new products and services to the public, they have to devote a significant amount of resources to meeting regulatory requirements. When the new product or service hits the market, there is still a risk that it won\u2019t work as they intended or that it won\u2019t be popular enough to continue supporting. The government noted that the sandbox would help mitigate this kind of risk and encourage companies to be more innovative. Dr. Ryan Clements, assistant professor, chair, Business Law and Regulation at the University of Calgary said, \u201ca provincial regulatory sandbox, focusing on the finance and financial technology sector, is a very positive development that will help to support innovation, competition and job formation, while ensuring appropriate consumer protection measures and regulatory safeguards.\u201d \u201cThe supervised environment lowers barriers to entry for new firms while creating controlled parameters to test consumer applications that could increase choice and lower the costs of financial products and services. It also facilitates efficiency, coordination, and information sharing across regulatory agencies.\u201d The provincial government would work with participating companies to make sure they take the appropriate precautions and provide safe and sound products and services to consumers. If the bill is passed, the government\u2019s goal is to start accepting sandbox applications by July 1. PARTICIPANT REQUIREMENTS If the Act passes, each company taking part in the sandbox will have to meet the following criteria, as outlined by the province: Physical presence requirement \u2013 Applicants would be required to maintain a physical presence in Alberta. For example, they will need to have an office in Alberta or staff living in Alberta. Financial services requirement \u2013 The sandbox would only be for companies that offer financial products or services. Innovation requirement \u2013 Applicants would have to adequately explain why each eligible product or service should be considered new and original, or at least how it is a new adaptation or material improvement of another product or service. Applicants would not receive exemptions for products or services that are already offered in Alberta by other companies. Business plan requirement \u2013 Applicants must provide a sound and viable business plan, including details for testing their financial product or service and plans to exit the regulatory sandbox. Participating companies would have up to two years in the sandbox to test their products, with the possibility to extend the period for one further year. Companies taking part may also have to abide by additional terms, conditions and restrictions, which the province would determine on a case-by-case basis. For example, participating companies may be required to: Consult a qualified expert or auditor. Limit the number of customers who can purchase the product or service being tested. Have a certain amount of cash or liquid capital to support the venture. Provide proof of appropriate insurance coverage. Implement specific financial security or surety requirements to mitigate risk and losses. Implement risk management policies and procedures. Maintain a consumer complaint mechanism to allow consumers to resolve concerns.",

On Wednesday, reports indicated that Jonathan Bailey and Simone Ashley, who starred in the recent sophomore season of the Netflix series, will be returning for its upcoming third installment. Ashley confirmed the news at a dinner hosted by Netflix to celebrate South Asian culture, revealing that her and Bailey's characters, Kathani \"Kate\" Sharma and Antony Bridgerton, are \"just getting started\" in their love story.\"We're going to be back! Kate and Anthony are just getting started,\" Ashley revealed. \"We have the amazing Jess Brownell who is taking the lead as showrunner in Season 3. In Season 2, there was a lot of push and pull between Kate and Anthony, there were complications with the family, and then they find each other towards the end. I think everything is just starting. I'd like to see Kate just let go a bit more and play more in Season 3 and kind of swim in that circle of love together.

Kate and Anthony are just getting started,\" Ashley revealed. \"We have the amazing Jess Brownell who is taking the lead as showrunner in Season 3. In Season 2, there was a lot of push and pull between Kate and Anthony, there were complications with the family, and then they find each other towards the end. I think everything is just starting. I'd like to see Kate just let go a bit more and play more in Season 3 and kind of swim in that circle of love together.

Though the majority of the series would follow the journey of Crawler and his friends protecting the world outside the usual channels taken by the professional heroes of the world, along with the young crime fighters of UA Academy, the series also dove into the past of some major protagonists and it seems that Eraserhead is set to redeem himself following his origin being revealed earlier in the series.In the latest chapter of My Hero Academia: Vigilantes, the crime fighters are attempting to protect the city known as Naruhata and Eraserhead is hurling himself directly into the fight, with his Quirk most likely set to be a major factor in saving lives. With the teacher of UA Academy having a power that allows him to negate the Quirk of others, he might be able to halt the fiery powers that are besieging the populace. In the main series, we've witnessed Eraserhead have to overcome some wild challenges over the course of the series, but in Vigilantes, we've seen the tragic origin he had as he grew up into the hero he would soon become.When Aizawa's early years were featured in Vigilantes, we were able to see a new side of the former vigilante turned homeroom teacher in the halls of UA, wherein he had an affinity for cats and was looking to open his own agency alongside his best friends, Present Mic and Oboro Shirakumo. Unfortunately, during a mission, Aizawa was unable to save the life of his friend Oboro and his dreams of opening a crime-fighting agency with his best friends were shattered. Now, fighting alongside Crawler and the other heroes in this past battle, Eraserhead might be able to find redemption in fighting against these fiery creations. My Hero Academia is slated to return with its sixth season later this fall, which will adapt the story of the War Arc to the anime adaptation, and rest assured, Eraserhead is set to play a significant role that will alter the future of the UA teacher forever.{replyCount}commentsHow do you see Vigilantes coming to an end?

The world of Fallout is one where the future envisioned by Americans in the late 1940s explodes upon itself through a nuclear war in 2077. The magic of the Fallout world is the harshness of the wasteland set against the previous generation\u2019s utopian idea of a better world through nuclear energy. Bethesda Software Details of Purnell\u2019s character are not being revealed; she is believed to be playing the lead, referred to as Jean, a young woman with a can-do attitude who may be hiding a dangerous secret.

Michael Green is said to have penned the script featuring a \u201cshift in genre and in tone\u201d and is set in post-war Venice following one of Christie\u2019s stories that is lesser-known. There are 33 of Christie\u2019s novels that could possibly be adapted, including Evil Under the Sun, Mrs. McGinty\u2019s Dead, and The ABC Murders. Death on the Nile was announced a few weeks after Murder on the Orient Express was released, however, all is quiet surrounding the title of the third adaptation for now. Image from 20th Century Fox.

            "content": "TL;DR: House of the Dragon is not the first Game of Thrones prequel HBO has made.It is the first one that fans will get to see when it premieres on August 21, 2022.All the other Game of Thrones prequels, sequels, and spinoffs keep changing names. \u2018House of the Dragon\u2019 star Matt Smith as Prince Daemon Targaryen | Ollie Upton/HBO Game of Thrones wrapped its eight-season run almost three years ago. But HBO is betting that fans want to see more content related to the world that George R. R. Martin has created in his numerous fantasy novels. The premium cabler currently has a number of Game of Thrones prequels, sequels, and spinoffs in the works \u2014 with one already set to premiere this year. Here\u2019s a quick rundown. \u2018House of the Dragon\u2019 will be the first \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 prequel to premiere on HBO HBO\u2019s first attempt at a Game of Thrones prequel starred Naomi Watts and was set 10,000 years before the original Westeros series. But the misfire was over before it began, as the cabler decided not to pick up the unnamed series. They quickly moved on to House of the Dragon. Which, so far, is the only Game of Thrones spinoff to be officially greenlit. According to Martin, all 10 episodes have been filmed and he has seen the \u201crough cuts.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m loving them,\u201d the author wrote on his Live Journal blog. \u201cOf course, a lot more work needs to be done. Special effects, color timing, score, all the post-production work. But the writing, the directing, the acting all look terrific. I hope you will like them as much as I do.\u201d HBO finally announced a premiere date for House of the Dragon \u2013 August 21, 2022. The new series focuses on the Targaryen civil war known as the Dance of the Dragon. George R. R. Martin is \u2018heavily involved\u2019 with all of the prequels, sequels, and spinoffs On his blog, Martin confirmed that several upcoming Game of Thrones prequels, sequels, and spinoffs were in development. He also revealed which showrunners were attached to each project, and told his fans that he is \u201cheavily involved\u201d with every one of them \u201cWe are developing live action shows for HBO, and animated shows for HBO Max. No, can\u2019t tell you how many. But it is my hope that a number of these shows will get on the air. Not all, no, it is never all, but more than one. I certainly hope so,\u201d Martin wrote. One of those spinoffs is reportedly The Sea Snake, formerly titled Nine Voyages. According to Entertainment Weekly, this is the one that\u2019s furthest along in development (sans House of the Dragon). This series \u2014 if it makes it to air \u2014 will focus on Corlys Velaryon (Steve Toussaint) \u2014 the greatest seafarer in the history of the Seven Kingdoms. The titles for the \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 spinoffs keep changing Another project in development is Ten Thousand Ships (working title), which is set a millennium before the events in Game of Thrones. That series would follow the iconic Princess Nymeria \u2014 a true warrior and ancestor of House Martell. A series based on The Tales of Dunk and Egg is also in the works. It\u2019s set 90 years before GOT, and has Steve Conrad as showrunner. \u201cHe\u2019s determined to do a faithful adaptation of the stories, which is exactly what I want; these characters and stories are very precious to me,\u201d Martin wrote on his blog. \u201cThe first season will be an adaptation of the first novella, The Hedge Knight.\u201d They have yet to land on a name for the series, though. Martin said that the current working title is A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms. But, they are also considering The Hedge Knight. Also in development is a rumored series set in the slums of King\u2019s Landing \u2014 Flea Bottom \u2014 about Westeros\u2019 poorest residents. There\u2019s also an animated series called The Golden Empire (working title), but Martin wouldn\u2019t reveal too many details. \u201cI am not allowed to talk about most of what\u2019s happening, except to say that things are moving very fast, and I love love love some of the concept art I am seeing,\u201d he said on his blog. \u201c\u2026I would tell you more if I could, I don\u2019t think I can say a word about the other animated shows. Not yet.\u201d All eight seasons of Game of Thrones are available on HBO Max.

            "full_description": "Midway through Apple TV+\u2019s new British spy series Slow Horses , veteran intelligence agent Jackson Lamb ( Gary Oldman ) studies a dead body at the bottom of the steps to his dingy office. Lamb\u2019s mortified underling Min Harper (Dustin Demri-Burns) insists that he didn\u2019t mean to kill this man. \u201cOf course you didn\u2019t,\u201d Lamb sneers. \u201cIf you meant to kill him, he\u2019d still be alive.\u201d Lamb\u2019s contempt for Min extends to all of the agents under his command, and with good reason. The Slow Horses, Lamb included, are all disgraced members of the British intelligence community for one reason or another. (In Min\u2019s case, he absent-mindedly left confidential information on a train for commuters to find.) Each has been assigned to an office known as Slough House, given demeaning, pointless busywork in the hopes that they will quit. When new-ish Slough House resident River Cartwright (Jack Lowden) asks Lamb what they are going to do about the public kidnapping of a Muslim student by a group of white nationalists, Lamb replies, \u201cWhat we always do here: absolutely nothing.\u201d If that was exactly what happened, Slow Horses \u2014 adapted by Veep writer Will Smith (no, not that Will Smith ) from a series of novels by Mick Herron, with a producer team that includes Justified boss Graham Yost \u2014 would have the makings of an amusingly dark workplace sitcom with an overqualified star. Inevitably, though, the Slough House spies find themselves involved in the kidnapping case \u2014 and the kidnappers\u2019 plan to behead their victim on a live feed \u2014 on multiple levels. And as a result, Slow Horses gets to have its cake and eat it too, combining a genuinely tense thriller plot with the unexpected comedy of the people trying to solve it being outcasts of whom nothing is expected. When a civilian witnesses the Slow Horses in unconventional action and asks what kind of spies they are, River shrugs and says, \u201cHard to tell, really.\u201d A decade ago, Gary Oldman played a very different kind of British agent in the 2011 version of John Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s Tinker Tailor Solder Spy . Lamb is presented as a man who has utterly given up. His hair is long and ratty, there are holes in his socks (which you can see because he frequently takes off his shoes at work), every pore and wrinkle on his face is on glaring display, and the only thing that tends to interrupt his regular naps at his desk is the sound of his own frequent farts. It is a delightful performance from a great dramatic actor who isn\u2019t allowed to be funny nearly as often as he should be. Every resigned gesture and every disdainful line reading is just right. And Oldman constantly keeps the audience guessing about how much Lamb may still care about any of these spy games, particularly in scenes he shares with his Darkest Hour co-star Kristin Scott Thomas, who plays a high-ranking MI5 official who would rather Slough House sink into the ground, never to be thought of again. River Cartwright is positioned as Lamb\u2019s spiritual opposite. Blonde, handsome, smart, passionate, and the grandson of an MI5 legend (played by Jonathan Pryce), he is obviously meant to be the hero of the more straightforward version of this story. Instead, due to an extremely public mistake, he is a Slow Horse, stuck with the most humiliating tasks available, like digging through the trash of a pundit who is himself barely relevant to the current discourse. Lowden does a nice job channeling that do-gooder mode while also fitting into the story\u2019s wry comic tone, and he\u2019s well-paired early on with Olivia Cooke as Slough House\u2019s newest recruit, Sid Baker, who seems even more misplaced here than River does. From left: Lowden, Christopher Chung (seated), Cooke, Paul Higgins. Apple TV+ The plot moves a bit sluggishly at first, though I should say that I\u2019ve read and enjoyed several of Herron\u2019s books, including the one that\u2019s the basis of this first season. This is a case of an adaptation perhaps being more appealing to those who don\u2019t know the source material \u2014 not because it\u2019s of lesser quality, but because it\u2019s so faithful that the early unfolding of the plot feels a bit obligatory. But by the time the Slow Horses have discovered their connection to the kidnapping \u2014 and, more importantly, have realized that they still like acting like spies when the rare opportunity arises \u2014 the rest of the season is on rails. There\u2019s also an impressive command of tone throughout, so that one scene can center on a ridiculous joke involving a Nineties folk rock hit, and the next can be a chilling suspense set piece involving the kidnappers threatening their captive. Everything complements everything else and makes it more interesting, rather than the humor making the plot feel dumb, or the life-and-death stakes making the gags seem in poor taste. Apple has already filmed a second season, which means the finale ends with an extreme rarity for a streaming show: a full trailer for what\u2019s coming next. Based on how lively and sharp and fun this first tale is, hopefully there will be much more of Slow Horses to come. The first two episodes of Slow Horses begin streaming on Apple TV+ on April 1, with additional installments releasing weekly. I\u2019ve seen all six episodes.",

Always a hot-button topic among theatre professionals and theatre fans; always a complex debate to resolve. Whenever a celeb is installed in a big role in a big production \u2013 especially one with little-to-no experience in performing arts \u2013 there are complaints of highly sought-after jobs being taken away from qualified professionals; of audiences ultimately losing out; of an art form that is already looked down upon by far too many people at risk of feeling like it\u2019s simply being cheapened. It\u2019s been a while since a piece of so-called stunt casting caused quite as much of a storm online as it did yesterday; but such is the power of Gemma Collins. The TOWIE, Celebrity Big Brother and Dancing On Ice meme machine was trending on Twitter all day following the announcement that she\u2019ll play Mama Morton for a select few dates in the UK and Ireland tour of Chicago. Mama Morton is, you\u2019ll remember, the part played by Queen Latifah in the Oscar-winning movie adaptation; the supporting role that gets to sing the absolute belters When You\u2019re Good To Mama and Class. Many actors are outraged by The GC\u2019s appointment, and to quote Mary Sunshine in We Both Reached For The Gun, it\u2019s perfectly understandable. They feel as if their profession \u2013 a craft they\u2019ll have spent an exhausting amount of time, money and energy perfecting \u2013 is being undermined by the fact a coveted role has been gifted to a relative newcomer for whom this could essentially be a side-hustle. \u2018No I\u2019m sorry but Gemma Collins being cast in Chicago is an absolute JOKE. We work tirelessly and pay THOUSANDS to train & audition,\u2019 wrote one actor on Twitter. \u2018There is a huge amount of talent out there who have worked their arses off to get that role. Bad form @ChicagoOnStage.\u2019 \u2018Absolutely ridiculous casting,\u2019 tweeted another. \u2018There are hundreds of much more talented performers who will be graduating from their respective theatre schools very soon, who would love a job \u2026 like this and would do loads better for a lot less money than she\u2019s being paid!\u2019 Gemma Collins is making her stage debut after joining the UK and Ireland tour of the musical (Picture: PA) In fairness to Gemma, she\u2019s not a total stranger to performing arts: as a teen she attended the Sylvia Young Theatre School, she released a Christmas single in 2020, and when she sang This Is Me on the BBC show All Together Now, she proved she has a good voice \u2026 even if she did lose her way a little. But still, as musical theatre headliners go, there\u2019s no denying she\u2019s a bit of a curveball. Casting a celebrity performer is one thing, but that\u2019s not what Gemma is known for being. It\u2019s easy to see why decisions like this are made, though. The argument from the marketing side, I suppose, would be the fact that stunt casting is what generates headlines, and what will \u2013 in theory \u2013 therefore translate to ticket sales. For a lot of people who don\u2019t consider themselves to be generally \u2018stagey\u2019, it\u2019s the big touring shows like this (and the big, exciting names above the marquee) that might persuade them to part with their cash. At a time when it\u2019s harder than ever to get people to spend money on pricey seats, producers need to do everything they can to avoid making huge losses. Plus, Chicago has form here: this is a show that has notoriously relied on starry casting on both sides of the Atlantic. Wendy Williams has played Mama Morton on Broadway; and their Roxie Harts have included Ashlee Simpson, Mel B and Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Erika Jayne. Pamela Anderson is taking over the role from next month. Here in the UK, Sinitta has just recently played Mama Morton; and the part\u2019s previously been taken by the likes of Jessie Wallace and Kelly Osbourne. The late Caroline Flack played Roxie, and figure skater Robin Cousins was once Billy Flynn. {\"@context\":\"https:\\/\\/schema.org\",\"@type\":\"VideoObject\",\"name\":\"Metro.co.uk\",\"duration\":\"T37S\",\"thumbnailUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/i.dailymail.co.uk\\/1s\\/2022\\/02\\/09\\/15\\/53975877-0-image-a-1_1644421540607.jpg\",\"uploadDate\":\"2022-02-09T15:45:03+0000\",\"description\":\"With support from her loved ones, Gemma reveals her own experiences to help shed light on the UK's mental health crisis.\",\"contentUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/videos.metro.co.uk\\/video\\/met\\/2022\\/02\\/09\\/2721180728497650404\\/480x270_MP4_2721180728497650404.mp4\",\"height\":270,\"width\":480} To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video In short, it\u2019s not like Gemma has been cast in a straight-faced production of Macbeth at the Globe.

            "full_description": "EXCLUSIVE: Here\u2019s a good-looking first English-language trailer for the German adaptation of hit series Your Honor . Leading German actors Sebastian Koch ( The Lives Of Others ) and Paula Beer ( Frantz ) star in the series, which is loosely based on the often-adapted Israeli original. The drama charts the story of an incorruptible judge who has spent his career fighting organized crime. Tables are turned when his teenage son is implicated in a hit-and-run case, seriously injuring the son of an arrested crime boss. Bryan Cranston recently starred in the U.S. version for Showtime. Also starring are Tobias Moretti ( Bad Banks ), Ursula Strauss ( Hotel Sacher ), Sascha Ger\u0161ak ( Bad Banks ), Taddeo Kufus ( 1917 ), Lena Kalisch ( Unorthodox ), and Rainer Bock ( Atlas ). The German version, titled Euer Ehren , heralds from SquareOne Productions, in co-production with Vienna\u2019s Mona Film, ARD/Degeto, and Austrian Pubcaster ORF. David Nawrath ( Atlas ) directs all six episodes and also serves as the series co-writer alongside David Marian M\u00f6hring. Shooting took place in Vienna, Innsbruck, and surroundings. The returnable six-episode thriller premieres in Germany on April 2nd for seven days via streaming followed by the linear broadcast on April 9 and 10 on public broadcaster ARD Degeto and Austrian broadcaster ORF. Euer Ehren is produced by Al Munteanu for SquareOne Productions, the production arm of the Munich-based distributor, with Thomas Hroch and Gerald Podgornig overseeing for Mona Film. The Israeli original was created by Ron Ninio and Shlomo Mashiach and produced by Ram Landers at Koda Communications and yes Studios. Sebastian Koch commented: \u201cJudge Jacobi\u2019s actions are for me in many ways a mirror of our society, I would almost say a reflection of the present world situation. He stumbles from one catastrophe into the next, without any emergency brake in sight purely because he is driven by the infinite love for his son. This is the main impetus for this story. Being personally forced to confront a situation that is actually hopeless.\u201d SquareOne Productions\u2019 Italian adaptation of the series \u2014 with co-production partner Indiana and Italy\u2019s public broadcaster RAI \u2014 premiered this month in Italy.",

            "content": "The\u00a0TV\u00a0show\u00a0Being Erica\u00a0aired on the CBC network from 2009-2011. It starred Erin Karpluk (Anna Benoit in\u00a0A Million Little Things) as Erica, a woman whose life was a chaotic mess. When she seeks the help of a therapist to work on her issues, she finds Dr. Tom\u2014a therapist that doesn\u2019t take care of his patients the traditional way. Instead, he sends them back to specific moments in time to see if changing the past can change the future. Although this show was popular with Canadian audiences, it only ran for four seasons. Now that\u00a0Being Erica\u00a0is streaming on platforms such as\u00a0Hulu\u00a0and\u00a0Amazon Prime, it found many more fans around the globe, giving rise to a potential American adaptation. Warning: If you haven\u2019t watched\u00a0Being Erica\u00a0yet, spoilers about the finale follow. According to Jana Sinyor, season 4 was a \u2018natural end\u2019 to \u2018Being Erica\u2019 Erin Karpluk in \u2018Being Erica\u2019 | Stephen Scott/SOAPnet via Getty Images Fans of Being Erica have mixed feelings about the show\u2019s end. Although the end of season 4 provided a natural ending to Erica\u2019s story for most fans, some were still craving more. However, according to an article on Insider, series creator Jana Sinyor knew season four would likely be the show\u2019s last. Being Erica\u00a0Season 4 ended with Erica finally becoming a therapist herself. As Dr. Erica prepared to take on her first patient, she had to say goodbye to Dr. Tom, who led her through her journey over the past four years. Although a relatively happy ending for a show, some of Erica\u2019s more challenging moments were glossed over in the finale, leaving some fans to wonder whether further resolution was on the table. \u2018Being Erica\u2019 was popular through its original run and is now on streaming The show accumulated fans throughout its run. However, Being Erica decreased its episode count with each season, finally ending with its fourth season, where much of Erica\u2019s story is wrapped up nicely for fans. There was some hope that there would be more original episodes. But the hope for fans faded as the months and years went on. Although it has been many years since the show\u2019s original run,\u00a0Being Erica\u00a0has seen new life on streaming services. It is available on Hulu and Amazon Prime, giving life to new fans who enjoy the show as much as its Canadian fans.

            "content": "Hulu/Netflix/Miramax/20th Century/Ringer illustration After riding the roller coaster of one of Hollywood\u2019s most compelling, unpredictable actors, here are his best (and worst) moments on screen It\u2019s hard to find a movie star career that has been more of a roller coaster than that of Ben Affleck. Upon breaking through with an Oscar win in 1998 for writing Good Will Hunting, he and Matt Damon looked primed for a Hollywood takeover. But while Damon\u2019s been the model of consistency ever since, Affleck has managed to have as many highs as lows, navigating box office bombs, personal issues, and viral Dunkin\u2019 Donuts runs. But Affleck is thriving once again thanks to a pair of critically adored performances and the reboot of Bennifer. And yet, it wasn\u2019t so long ago that people were seriously putting Mark Wahlberg ahead of him in the Boston actor rankings. Part of what separates Affleck from the likes of Wahlberg and other A-list actors of their generation is that he never appears to be following a playbook or master plan; he\u2019s unpredictable. Now, that can lead both to pleasant surprises and disastrous misses. While Wahlberg is constantly either trying to launch his own franchise or find a new true story to tell, take a look through Affleck\u2019s filmography and attempt to find a through line or pattern\u2014no one with a methodical strategy plots out a two-year run of Daredevil, Gigli, Paycheck, Surviving Christmas, and Jersey Girl. And more recently, Affleck has gone against the industry\u2019s superhero and IP wave by becoming the movie star most invested in the adult drama, as evidenced by five of his six projects from 2020 and 2021. (Ironically, Zack Snyder\u2019s Justice League somehow was the only one deemed Oscar-worthy.) With the release of Deep Water\u2014the erotic thriller that neither Affleck nor Ana de Armas will ever acknowledge the existence of\u2014it\u2019s the right time to go full accountant and crunch the numbers to rank every single Affleck performance. To be clear, this will be an examination of the actor\u2019s performance, not the movies overall, which means Pearl Harbor\u2014as a very, very hypothetical example\u2014could be higher than expected! But most of all, assessing what Affleck has done with each of these performances should forever prove how baffling it is that this winner of Best Original Screenplay and Best Picture has never been nominated for an acting Oscar. Good hunting to us! 55. Paycheck, 2003 Be prepared to hear a lot about Affleck\u2019s Razzie-winning 2003. In what should have been his Face/Off or Mission: Impossible II, Affleck gets saddled with post-U.S. peak John Woo and a movie that lacks any of the fun of the renowned action director\u2019s previous work. This clunky sci-fi flick stars Affleck as reverse engineer Michael Jennings, who is dealing with such high-security stuff that his memory must be wiped after each gig. Personally, I wish I could erase the memory of how bad the chemistry is between Affleck and his love interest, Uma Thurman, despite a pretty solid goodbye speech from Affleck as he\u2019s about to die. \u201cRemember me,\u201d he tells her, even if it\u2019s for the best that no one remembers Paycheck. 54. Buffy the Vampire Slayer, 1992 Affleck\u2019s \u201cBasketball Player No. 10\u201d gets a single line: \u201cTake it, man,\u201d which he says when he\u2019s so scared by the literal werewolf guarding him that he just hands over the ball. He does do a decent job of looking terrified, so how could such a small, uncredited role be among his worst? Well: \u201cI went to the movie and I was like, \u2018That is not my voice. That is not me,\u2019\u201d Affleck admitted in 2020. \u201cApparently [director Fran Rubel Kuzui] hated my performance so much that she looped the entire performance, which was one line. But, yes, I am dubbed in English!\u201d It\u2019s impressive that his career wasn\u2019t slayed right then. 53. Joseph: King of Dreams, 2000 It speaks volumes that the sole animated film on Affleck\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is so low on this list. But maybe it shouldn\u2019t be surprising considering this biblical musical was the only DreamWorks Animation production to go straight to DVD until Trollhunters: Rise of the Titans joined the not-so-illustrious club in 2021. In the adaptation of the Book of Genesis, Affleck voices Jacob\u2019s chosen son, Joseph, but all you can hear is Ben Affleck trying to read the bible. And in this (74-minute!!) musical, Affleck doesn\u2019t even handle the singing, which there is a lot of. With so little for him to do, it\u2019s clear he was just dreaming of a nice, easy paycheck. 52. Man About Town, 2006 Back-to-back straight-to-DVD releases! King of Dreams\u2019 lack of a theatrical release can\u2019t really be pinned on Affleck, who at the time still felt like the next big thing. But the fate of writer-director Mike Binder\u2019s embarrassingly bad dramedy says a lot about how out in the wilderness Affleck was at this point in his career. Starring opposite the very straight-to-DVD cast of Jerry O\u2019Connell, Rebecca Romijn, Bai Ling, and Hitch star Amber Valletta, Affleck is a douchey talent agent who takes up journaling as his personal and professional lives begin to fall apart. Often left to just mope around, it\u2019s unclear what the appeal of the role was for Affleck\u2014and don\u2019t even get us started on the wild dentist-surgery sequence that leaves him with some of the worst fake teeth in cinema history. Man About Town is such a miss that you couldn\u2019t have blamed Affleck if he was worried that using \u201ctown\u201d in the title of another movie would invite bad juju. 51. Reindeer Games, 2000 Where to start with this semi-watchable mess? Maybe with the fact that pre\u2013Fast & Furious Vin Diesel left the project due to issues with the script. Or maybe that this Christmas-themed crime film was released in February. Or maybe with Affleck\u2019s over-his-head criminal going by two names: Rudy and Nick. On the nose much? Here\u2019s hoping one day we get the Ben and Charlize Theron collaboration that we actually deserve. 50. Gigli, 2003 Speaking of terrible character names: Larry Gigli. Really? Well, he does keep reminding us that it rhymes with \u201creally,\u201d as in, \u201cYes, his name really is Larry Gigli.\u201d This infamous bomb not only almost ended Affleck\u2019s run as a movie star, it also seemed to end his engagement to costar Jennifer Lopez, who postponed their wedding only a month after the $4 million opening of this $75 million Razzie darling. Thankfully, both Affleck\u2019s career and his relationship with J.Lo eventually earned a renaissance, but the film\u2019s reputation as one of the worst ever made (according to Richard Roeper) is well-earned between Affleck\u2019s weird attempt at a mobster voice and this Larry Gigli monologue that belongs in the cringe hall of fame: \u201cLet me tell you who the fuck I am. I am the fucking sultan of slick, Sadie. I am the rule of fucking cool. You want to be a gangster, you want to be a thug, you just sit at my fucking feet and gather the pearls that emanate forth from me. Because I\u2019m the fuckin\u2019 original, straight-first-foremost, pimp-mack fuckin\u2019 hustler, original gangster\u2019s gangster.\u201d And yet I don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite as bad as its reputation. If it wasn\u2019t caught up in the Bennifer PR machine, it probably would\u2019ve just been a forgotten miss. I guess love can cost something. 49. Glory Daze, 1995 In his last role before his breakout, Affleck leads this little-seen raunchy comedy as impending college graduate Jack Freeman, who wears dog tags, runs around shirtless in jeans after getting kicked off a city bus, and says things like, \u201cThe pimp jacket is tits, dude\u2014what\u2019s the stress factor?\u201d But shout-out to the casting director for somehow getting Affleck, Sam Rockwell, Brendan Fraser, Leah Remini, French Stewart, Matthew McConaughey, and a blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-him Matt Damon in a movie that there\u2019s no chance you\u2019ve ever seen. 48. Jersey Girl, 2004 Affleck\u2019s frequent collaborator Kevin Smith proved to be out of his element with this dramedy that briefly reunited the star with J.Lo shortly after the Gigli catastrophe and their breakup. Bad timing alert! Affleck goes full dick-mode as jerk publicist Ollie Trink\u00e9, who is forced to soften following the death of his wife (Lopez) in childbirth. This allows for plenty of dramatic beats for Affleck, some of which he pulls off better than others. Bonus points, though, for 2004 Will Smith\u2014the world\u2019s biggest movie star\u2014showing up as himself to declare that he\u2019s \u201cridiculously\u201d hung and deliver the sentimental parenting speech that moves Ollie to give up his corporate dreams in favor of being the best father possible. (If someone isn\u2019t already hard at work on Jersey Girl 2, in which Ollie has only 20 minutes to help Smith revise his Oscar speech after he slaps someone onstage, then what are we even doing?) 47. Pearl Harbor, 2001 Pearl Harbor, a reminder that Affleck and Josh Hartnett were considered to be at the same level at one point and that someone thought it would be a good idea for Michael Bay to direct a three-hour movie about one of the darkest days in U.S. history. The king Roger Ebert sums it up like only he could: \u201cIts centerpiece is 40 minutes of redundant special effects, surrounded by a love story of stunning banality. The film has been directed without grace, vision, or originality, and although you may walk out quoting lines of dialogue, it will not be because you admire them.\u201d In that stunningly banal love triangle that also includes Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale, Affleck plays Rafe McCawley, a dyslexic military pilot. Affleck sure looks like a movie star here, but he rarely gets the chance to prove he is one, as every character moment feels like it\u2019s just biding time for Bay to go Full Bay. 46. The Last Thing He Wanted, 2020 On paper, this critically panned political thriller should have been a slam dunk due to the presence of Affleck and Anne Hathaway, source material from esteemed writer Joan Didion, and direction from up-and-coming filmmaker Dee Rees (Mudbound). But the result was a 5 percent score on Rotten Tomatoes, a Razzie nom for Hathaway, and a film released on Netflix in February 2020 that couldn\u2019t even find an audience at a time when the world was pining for anything half-interesting to watch. Affleck must have been drawn in by Rees and Hathaway, because his character, State Department official Treat Morrison, sure wasn\u2019t it. Affleck is extremely overqualified for what\u2019s on the page and the roughly 15 minutes of screen time he has\u2014basically getting paid well to be on a poster and help make a lackluster twist feel impactful. 45. Daredevil, 2003 Affleck\u2019s take on the blind vigilante lawyer Matt Murdock was one of the first misses in the pre-MCU superhero era that included hit franchises like Spider-Man, X-Men, and Blade. And Charlie Cox\u2019s Daredevil later becoming the most beloved character in Netflix\u2019s short-lived Marvel TV Universe hasn\u2019t helped the lasting memory of the original big-screen version. Affleck proves capable of handling the action and fight sequences, but the theme of him having to play straight man opposite scenery-chewing costars continues (Colin Farrell and Michael Clarke Duncan are both going for it in the best way). After a tepid response (even Affleck has called it \u201csilly\u201d) and a canceled sequel, Affleck appeared to forever swear off superheroes \u2026 at least until he looked up and saw the signal. 44. School Ties, 1992 Outside of getting to hang with BFF Matt Damon, future Good Will Hunting pal Cole Hauser, 1992 hotshot Chris O\u2019Donnell, and no. 1 on the call sheet Brendan Fraser, there\u2019s not much for Affleck to do in his film debut besides be a pretty convincing antisemite named Chesty Smith. Props to Affleck for staying true to his character\u2019s name and going shirtless in a scene in which a bunch of (otherwise fully clothed) boys are horsing around together! 43. Daddy and Them, 2001 This kicks off a run of glorified Affleck cameos on our list. For his two scenes as Arkansas lawyer Lawrence Bowen, Affleck is paired with Jamie Lee Curtis as Lawrence\u2019s wife and law partner, Elaine. The duo\u2019s presence and bickering is random, unnecessary to the plot, and also the high point of the small film from writer-director-star Billy Bob Thornton. 42. 200 Cigarettes, 1999 Credited as the dim-witted and flirtatious \u201cBartender,\u201d Affleck floats in the background as people like Paul Rudd, Kate Hudson, and Courtney Love take center stage. He eventually gets to expertly deliver some deliciously lame pickup lines, like, \u201cMy clothes and those clothes would look good on my floor,\u201d and \u201cHow do you like your eggs in the morning: scrambled or fertilized?\u201d But what a historic missed opportunity to have a movie called 200 Cigarettes and not have the prince of paparazzi smoking shots take a drag! 41. Clerks II, 2006 Again, Affleck is simply and appropriately named, this time in Kevin Smith\u2019s hangout sequel as \u201cGawking Guy.\u201d He gets only one line but he nails the \u201cgawking\u201d when his fast-food order is interrupted by an employee\u2019s fianc\u00e9e walking in, climbing on the counter, and making out with them. Also, you have to respect the facial hair choice. 40. Suicide Squad, 2016 After debuting in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (stay tuned!), Affleck returned a few months later as the Caped Crusader to help launch the supervillain team-up and DC Extended Universe. Brief flashbacks first reveal Batman\u2019s role in capturing Deadshot (Will Smith) and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), and then a mid-credits scene between Bruce Wayne and Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) paves the way for Justice League. Not much to brag about there, but, as you\u2019ll come to see, I\u2019m higher on Batfleck than most. 39. Runner Runner, 2013 Affleck isn\u2019t the first, and he won\u2019t be the last, to win an Oscar and then follow it up with a bomb. (Please skip Bright 2, Will Smith.) Here, the high was the Best Picture victory for Argo, and the low was the release soon thereafter of the film that finally made Hollywood admit that Justin Timberlake isn\u2019t a movie star. For a project about gambling and money, you couldn\u2019t have asked for better writers than Rounders and Billions masterminds Brian Koppelman and David Levien, but the trouble started on set (director Brad Furman lost control of the movie and wanted his name taken off) and not even a Hail Mary from Affleck and his Oscar-winning Argo editor could save it after filming ended. However, Affleck is far from the problem onscreen, getting to mix it up and go big as Ivan Block, a villain who enjoys giving steam-room speeches about Napoleon and feeding his enemies to crocodiles. Back in 2013, EW\u2019s Darren Franich correctly bet that Affleck would emerge mostly unscathed: \u201cFor Affleck, Runner Runner is a minor dark note in a bright phase of his career, notable mainly because it feels beamed in from an alternate universe where Affleck never staged a comeback and stars in movies like Runner Runner.\u201d 38. Phantoms, 1998 \u201cAffleck was the bomb in Phantoms!\u201d While I can\u2019t go as far as that wall-breaking declaration made by Holden McNeil (Affleck) in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, Affleck\u2019s Sheriff Bryce Hammond is an effective horror movie hero, thanks to his killing of the deadly creature and relaying of the quintessential monster-flick line, \u201cSend everyone!\u201d 37. Going All the Way, 1997 Buried between Affleck\u2019s memorable 1997 one-two punch of Chasing Amy and Good Will Hunting was a film that is almost impossible to find. (Thank you to Casa Video in Tucson, Arizona, for making sure I could complete this full ranking!) It felt right to place Going All the Way next to Phantoms\u2014even if Jay of Jay and Silent Bob did not also deem Affleck \u201cthe bomb\u201d in this small indie. Affleck is serviceable in the sidekick role as Tom \u201cGunner\u201d Casselman, a veteran of the Korean War who takes a shy former high school classmate (future Lost star Jeremy Davies) under his wing. Rachel Weisz, Rose McGowan, Lesley Ann Warren, and Affleck are all predictably stellar when given the opportunity, but this is Davies\u2019s movie, for better or for worse. 36. Surviving Christmas, 2004 Surely, many of you are asking, \u201cHow can a critically savaged film that only made back a third of its budget and earned Affleck his latest Razzie nom and capped an all-time disastrous two years for him (Daredevil, Gigli, Paycheck, Jersey Girl, Surviving Christmas) be this far from the bottom?\u201d I will admit that Surviving Christmas is as bad as you\u2019d expect a movie from the director of Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo to be. But! It\u2019s genuinely impressive how committed Affleck is to going off his rocker as advertising exec and classic rich guy jackass Drew Latham, who, when left alone for the holidays, pays the occupants of his childhood home to pretend to be his family. This psychopath instantly embraces this fake reality to an alarming degree, making this the closest Affleck will ever get to remaking Big. I\u2019m not saying the movie should be added to your annual Christmas viewing rotation, but you\u2019d at least survive a single watch. 35. To the Wonder, 2012 There\u2019s only so much to say about Affleck in Terrence Malick\u2019s predictably polarizing experimental drama, because there\u2019s only so much Affleck gets to say. While there\u2019s minimal dialogue in the entire film (the last reviewed by Ebert before his death; he gave it 3.5 stars), it\u2019s especially true for Affleck, whose fleeting lines almost always come in the background as the scenes focus on other stars (Olga Kurylenko, Rachel McAdams, and Javier Bardem). Despite that, Affleck is both never distracting and someone you can\u2019t look away from. And the opportunity paid off in other ways for Affleck, who has said he kept a watchful eye on Malick before heading off to direct Argo. 34. State of Play, 2009 Affleck, McAdams, Russell Crowe, and Helen Mirren starred in this solid but unspectacular adaptation of the hit 2003 British series. But this is Crowe\u2019s show, with Affleck in supporting position as clean-cut congressman Stephen Collins, who calls on his former college roommate (Crowe), now an investigative reporter, when an aide he was having an affair with is killed. As credible as Affleck is in his scenes opposite Crowe, once again his presence seems to be in service of an inevitable and predictable twist. 33. Justice League, 2017 This movie is so universally hated that Warner Bros. was cyberbullied into giving Zack Snyder $100 million more to make a longer, slightly improved version. But I\u2019ll forever contend that Affleck is a good Batman/Bruce Wayne and could have been a great one under better circumstances and a different (I don\u2019t want to be bullied online, so I won\u2019t say \u201cbetter\u201d) director. There are some nice flashes (entering the speed force) here from Affleck, especially when it comes to delivering one-liners, but the comedy ceiling is only so high in such a dark world. 32. Zack Snyder\u2019s Justice League, 2021 When I\u2019m on my deathbed, I\u2019ll look back at all that I could have accomplished if I hadn\u2019t spent a total of eight hours watching two separate iterations of Zack Snyder\u2019s pandemic hobby. But Affleck\u2019s performance in this version benefits from more time devoted to the chemistry between Affleck and Gal Gadot and the new post-apocalyptic batshit dynamic between Affleck and Jared Leto. That dream sequence in which the Joker talks about giving Batman a \u201creach-around\u201d and Batman drops an F-bomb might be the most interesting either of those actors was allowed to be in those roles. Wait, did I just talk myself into another four hours of Zack Snyder Batman content?! 31. Forces of Nature, 1999 This Affleck and Sandra Bullock rom-com\u2014that for some reason is shot like Traffic and opens with a horny grandpa having a stripper-induced heart attack at a bachelor party\u2014coasts on the charisma of its young stars, even if they lack romantic chemistry. The high point of blurb writer Ben and bagel shop owner Sarah\u2019s road trip is at a gay bar where Affleck loosens up and unleashes a striptease that forces you to picture a world in which he had taken on the Matthew McConaughey role in Magic Mike. Maybe he can still get in on the Last Dance? 30. Smokin\u2019 Aces, 2006 If you ever need a reminder of how big Entourage and Ari Gold became, watch Jeremy Piven be the catalyst for the events of a movie that features Affleck, Ryan Reynolds, Chris Pine, Taraji P. Henson, Common, Joel Edgerton, Andy Garcia, Alicia Keys, Jason Bateman, and Ray Liotta. Affleck\u2019s bail bondsman Jack Dupree is initially positioned as a major player, introducing Piven\u2019s magician/wannabe gangster to his cohorts and the audience. And he looks cool doing it, with a cigarette (take that, 200 Cigarettes!), a handlebar mustache, and a kegel hat. Too bad it\u2019s short-lived: Pine\u2019s neo-Nazi shockingly takes Dupree out only 31 minutes in, setting the table for the blood bath that is to come. 29. The Third Wheel, 2002 In the year of our lord 2002, Affleck was starring opposite Samuel L. Jackson, taking over for Harrison Ford as Jack Ryan \u2026 and playing fourth fiddle to Luke Wilson, Denise Richards, and someone named Jay Lacopo in a straight-to-DVD comedy about a houseless man terrorizing a first date. As you\u2019d hope for his sake, Affleck is the best part of this straight-to-DVD comedy: As Michael, the supportive work friend of Wilson\u2019s Stanley, Affleck is a great hype man, riling up his \u201cmad dog\u201d to ask out Richards\u2019s Diana. And it\u2019s when Michael\u2019s following Stanley and Diana to ensure things go well that Affleck finds his own comedy gold with none other than a pre-fame Melissa McCarthy. Out of nowhere, the two end up going at it like animals on a motorcycle, with Michael declaring, \u201cI always wanted to get my swerve on on my bike!\u201d Honestly, if the movie had steered into that direction earlier, it might have at least gotten a limited theatrical release. 28. The Sum of All Fears, 2002 As I just mentioned, when Affleck wasn\u2019t slumming it in 2002, he was also picking up the Jack Ryan mantle and following in the footsteps of Ford and Alec Baldwin. Related side note: Does every white movie star get a turn playing Jack Ryan? Also, why does every white movie star want to play Jack Ryan? There\u2019s an argument to be made that Jack Ryan feels so \u201990s that it should have stayed there, a stance backed up by the fact that none of the movies or series centered on him in the past two decades have made any real impact. More than Ford, Affleck does possess the \u201cNo, I\u2019m an analyst, I can\u2019t do field work\u201d greenness that is such a part of the Ryan mystique. But in the end, The Sum of All Fears is the definition of a middle-of-the-road film, which makes it a natural fit for this positioning. 27. Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice, 2016 Have I mentioned that I\u2019m pro-Batfleck? Affleck was riding high on his comeback after Argo\u2019s win for Best Picture, and his decision to play Batman was the ultimate heat check. Now, you could argue that heat check went up in flames, but it wasn\u2019t all bad. I\u2019m convinced there\u2019s a quality movie in Batman v Superman, especially the first half. The Affleck and Gal Gadot chemistry is crackling from the jump, while the out-of-costume not-so meet-cute for Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent (Henry Cavill), aided by Jesse Eisenberg\u2019s bananas Lex Luthor interpretation, shows promise that is never fulfilled. And that\u2019s more than we can say for Clooney! 26. Shakespeare in Love, 1998 Opposite then-girlfriend Gwyneth Paltrow, Affleck takes on a supporting role in one of his first post\u2013Good Will Hunting films. He doesn\u2019t show up until more than 30 minutes into the controversial Best Picture winner, but when he does, it\u2019s a welcomed sight, both for the audience and the characters. As 16th-century actor Ned Alleyn, Affleck brings a bit of swagger that has you wishing that this was either Ned in Love, or that Affleck was in the Billy Shakespeare spot (sorry not sorry, Joey Fiennes!). 25. Armageddon, 1998 Affleck\u2019s debut as a \u201cmovie star\u201d\u2014which came months after his Good Will Hunting Oscar\u2014proved to be the mixed bag that most Michael Bay vehicles are. The highest-grossing film released in 1998, which had nine writers work on the script (J.J. Abrams and Tony Gilroy among them), was destroyed by critics and earned seven Razzie noms, including one for on-screen couple Affleck and Liv Tyler. That being said, Armageddon is exactly what you\u2019d want from a Michael Bay space movie. And in a cast stacked with veteran stars and character actors, Affleck handles himself well, coming across like the IT actor of the moment that he was. And don\u2019t think we didn\u2019t consider giving his commentary on the Armageddon DVD its own spot on this list! You won\u2019t want to miss a thing when it comes to his performance there. 24. Live by Night, 2016 Let\u2019s be clear: Affleck\u2019s last directorial effort to date isn\u2019t bad, but it also definitely isn\u2019t Gone Baby Gone, The Town, or Argo. Variety\u2019s Owen Gleiberman hit it on the head in his review: \u201cIt\u2019s like seeing the ghost of a terrific movie: All the pieces are in place, yet as you\u2019re watching it, there doesn\u2019t seem to be quite enough there.\u201d Following the critical and commercial success of the aforementioned three films, there were high expectations for Affleck writing, directing, and starring in a prohibition-era gangster film based on a book from Gone Baby Gone and Shutter Island author Dennis Lehane. Unfortunately, instead of another home run, it was more of a soft single through the infield. As always, Affleck is solid at the center of his own movie, this time as WWI veteran turned bootlegger Joe Coughlin. But, unlike in his other outings, there\u2019s no scene-stealing supporting turns to help carry the load, and for most of the movie, Affleck is dressed like Lou Bega. It seems reasonable to think the mixed response and financial loss of Live by Night is part of the reason he\u2019s still yet to return behind the camera. 23. He\u2019s Just Not That Into You, 2009 Thanks to the alphabet, Affleck gets top billing in this star-studded romantic dramedy, despite probably having the least amount of screen time of the A-list cast. But it doesn\u2019t matter, because he comes off as extremely likable as the marriage-opposed Neil, which speaks completely to the aura of Affleck (given that Neil\u2019s lone distinguishing characteristic is his stance on marriage). A rewatch also serves as a reminder that his scene partners are Jennifer Aniston and Bradley Cooper, both of whom we\u2019d pay to see him reunite with. Just imagine an Affleck and Cooper buddy comedy, with them portraying 21st-century versions of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. 22. Mallrats, 1995 Kevin Smith\u2019s cult classic marks Affleck\u2019s entrance into the View Askewniverse. Before being upgraded to a Smith lead, he plays Shannon Hamilton, the scumbag manager at the mall\u2019s Fashionable Male clothing store and romantic rival to Jason Lee\u2019s main character. Affleck\u2019s limited screen time is a positive addition, even as his character leaves a disgusting impression due to a late film reveal. And clearly Affleck and Smith left an impression on each other, as it\u2019s still the most substantial ongoing collaborative relationship Affleck has had with a filmmaker not named Ben Affleck. 21. Jay and Silent Bob Reboot, 2019 Reprising his role as Chasing Amy\u2019s Holden McNeil, Affleck rejoined the View Askewniverse after 13 years away. Now a podcaster, Holden is reunited with Jay and Silent Bob at Chronic-Con, where it\u2019s revealed he fathered a daughter with Alyssa (Joey Lauren Adams). It\u2019s a five-minute sequence about fatherhood that works as a nostalgia-fueled blend of earnestness, sentimentality, and winking at the camera, with references to almost a dozen other Affleck movies. Did we need Jay and Silent Bob back in our lives? Probably not, but at least we got Affleck saying this to his movie daughter: \u201cThey\u2019re gone, girl. They\u2019re on the town. It\u2019s just us. We\u2019re the just us league. What are you looking at me like that for? You\u2019re like, ar, go fuck yourself.\u201d 20. Extract, 2009 Featuring Jason Bateman, Kristen Wiig, Mila Kunis, J.K. Simmons, and a very game Affleck, this comedy from Office Space writer-director Mike Judge doesn\u2019t quite live up to its talented cast. In one of his rare non\u2013Kevin Smith funnyman roles, Affleck is Extract\u2019s secret weapon as Dean Slade, the bar-owning, weed-smoking, shaggy-hair-having, free-spirited best friend to Bateman\u2019s uptight lead character. He\u2019s the kind of guy who suggests you hire a gigolo to have sex with your wife and then asks for his cut (\u201cI don\u2019t think they call it a pimp when it\u2019s a male prostitue,\u201d he argues). Judge greatly misjudged the decision to essentially sideline Affleck for the second half of the film. 19. Bounce, 2000 Affleck has plenty of experience working with past, present, and future romantic partners, yet that real-life chemistry often doesn\u2019t translate to the screen. But the best of such instances was his reunion with Shakespeare in Love costar and on-again, off-again girlfriend Gwyneth Paltrow in Bounce. Affleck stars as Buddy Amaral, a playboy advertising exec (were there any other kind in this era of movies?) whose life goes on a downward spiral after a plane that he was supposed to be on crashes. This fact is unbeknownst to Abby, the widow of the man who took Buddy\u2019s seat. After checking in on her, Buddy eventually starts a relationship with Abby. This is an extremely gross premise, but the strong chemistry with Paltrow, some solid monologues, and Affleck\u2019s character doing a dry run of Jackson Maine at an awards show make Bounce worth revisiting. 18. The Company Men, 2011 It\u2019s very possible that you\u2019ve never seen The Company Men, or even heard of it. Sandwiched between the smashes The Town and Argo, this modestly budgeted recession drama from writer-director John Wells (ER, Shameless) was released to little fanfare. Surrounded by grumpy elder statesmen like Kevin Costner, Chris Cooper, Craig T. Nelson, and Tommy Lee Jones, Affleck livens the action up as Bobby Walker, a self-proclaimed \u201c37-year-old unemployed loser who can\u2019t support his family.\u201d The transition from successful white collar businessman to rookie construction worker allows Affleck a few impassioned moments that help elevate the film and performance. Plus, you can never go wrong with Masshole Affleck. 17. Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, 2001 Respect to Kevin Smith for deciding to completely ignore continuity in his View Askewniverse, as Strike Back finds Affleck playing both himself and Holden McNeil, while his Chasing Amy partner Jason Lee is playing his character from Mallrats. Trust us, don\u2019t think too hard about it. Early on, Holden shows up to teach Jay and Silent Bob about the internet and shout out Affleck being, as previously alluded to, \u201cthe bomb in Phantoms.\u201d The titular duo then arrive in Hollywood where Matt Damon and a frosted-tipped Affleck are shooting Good Will Hunting 2: Hunting Season. It\u2019s possible that the longtime collaborators have never had more fun than in this scene, which ends with Affleck gleefully saying the cops aren\u2019t there to arrest him because he wasn\u2019t with a sex worker \u2026 that day. We definitely liked that applesauce, Ben. 16. Dogma, 1999 Did someone mention Damon and Affleck having a ball in a Smith movie? The highest-grossing release of the filmmaker\u2019s career to that point starred the recent Oscar winners as expletive-dropping fallen angels Loki and Bartleby, who have been banished from Heaven for insubordination. The controversial film finds the pair getting into some rowdy shenanigans, only for Affleck\u2019s Bartleby to take a late dark turn, killing Damon\u2019s Loki for losing faith. Bartleby\u2019s wings are soon shot off, prompting a delirious laugh that is also downright angelic. 15. Chasing Amy, 1997 Our Smith-Affleck run in the rankings ends where Affleck\u2019s leading man career begin in earnest. You could say the whole concept of Smith\u2019s well-received rom-com has aged poorly, but even then, his treatment of queer sexuality seemed poorly handled. That aside, Affleck, Jason Lee, and the Golden Globe\u2013nominated Joey Lauren Adams, who it still feels like should have been the true breakout here, are all excellent. While Lee dominates the comedy, Affleck and Adams\u2014as comic book artists Holden McNeil and Alyssa Jones\u2014deliver the romance and drama. In some of the heaviest scenes to ever be featured in a Smith film, Affleck shines, whether it be in his confession of love (which turns into an argument and then a rainy makeout session) or as he quietly sheds a tear post-breakup. No wonder producers and studios were chasing Affleck after this. 14. Changing Lanes, 2002 You know who thinks this is too low? Matt Damon! For EW\u2019s March 2022 cover, Damon interviewed Affleck and shared his five favorite performances from his BFF, which unexpectedly included this thriller. But it\u2019s not a surprise to those who have seen Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson\u2019s two-hander that begins with a car crash and evolves into a tale of revenge, redemption, and ethical dilemmas. As Wall Street attorney Gavin Banek, Affleck is again a rich douche, and his sleazy handling of an accident with Jackson\u2019s character leads to a fire and rage from both actors\u2014old hat for Jackson, but surprising and welcome from Affleck. 13. The Tender Bar, 2021 The no. 1 testament to how incredibly watchable Affleck is as bar owner Charlie McGuire/father figure Uncle Charlie in George Clooney\u2019s coming-of-age drama is that I had zero interest in anything going on when he wasn\u2019t around. And only part of that was thanks to this true and necessary quote: \u201cUncle Charlie says the Yankees are assholes.\u201d Clooney the director would have turned in another boring, buzz-free movie if it weren\u2019t for Affleck\u2019s breezy, charming performance as the ultimate cool, sage uncle, for which he recently earned SAG and Golden Globe nominations only to come up shy of landing his first acting Oscar nod. 12. Dazed and Confused, 1993 Matthew McConaughey as Wooderson is the performance that has endured from Richard Linklater\u2019s beloved high school flick, but Affleck leaves the first memorable mark of his career as paddle-wielding bully Fred O\u2019Bannion, who takes a bit too much joy in spanking eighth graders. \u201cBen was smart and full of life,\u201d recalled Linklater of young Affleck. \u201cYou don\u2019t cast the unappealing person, you cast the appealing person.\u201d And it doesn\u2019t get more appealing than watching O\u2019Bannion get his comeuppance when he\u2019s lured into a setup that ends with white paint being dumped all over him. It leads to an all-time \u201closing your shit\u201d reaction from Affleck, so much so that it\u2019s extremely confusing that O\u2019Bannion is never seen again. 11. Argo, 2012 It\u2019s interesting that, for what is likely his career pinnacle, Affleck\u2019s acting is almost never mentioned. That\u2019s understandable considering his Golden Globe win for Best Director and the film\u2019s Best Picture victory at the Oscars, but Affleck\u2019s turn as CIA exfiltration specialist Tony Mendez shouldn\u2019t be ignored\u2014and we\u2019re not just talking about his great \u201970s look. While the part is more subdued and less flashy than the Academy is usually inclined to recognize, Affleck is a steady guide through this world and provides himself with a couple of meaty, quotable sequences. One example: when he assures the nervous diplomats whom he\u2019s come to save that, \u201cThis is what I do. I get people out\u2014and I\u2019ve never left anyone behind.\u201d You can\u2019t not love a classic \u201cthis is what I do\u201d monologue! 10. Triple Frontier, 2019 Netflix\u2019s heist-survival film was in the works for almost a decade, with seemingly every male star of a certain age attached at one point. In the end, the cameras rolled with the peak alpha-male group of Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnam, Pedro Pascal, and Garrett Hedlund. Affleck plays the band of brothers\u2019 washed-up former captain, Tom \u201cRedfly\u201d Davis. After initially leaving the film for personal reasons, Affleck returned to the role\u2014and it seemed like his troubles came with him. (The infamous phoenix back tattoo photo was taken during this production.) But Affleck\u2019s sad-sack nature and burgeoning beer gut played perfectly into the character and performance. Redfly, the same guy who was the hardest to convince to take the mission, is the one who gets greedy when they find more money than expected at a drug lord\u2019s house, setting up the unfortunate events to come. But before tragedy strikes, Affleck makes you feel Redfly\u2019s \u201cgetting too old for this shit\u201d schtick while also making you understand why these other guys would follow him across a mountain that\u2019s difficult for horses to navigate. 9. Deep Water, 2022 Even I can\u2019t believe this cracked the top 10! So much (like soooo much) has already been written about Unfaithful director Adrian Lyne\u2019s long-awaited return\u2014and I\u2019ve happily read it all. Sadly, despite the internet\u2019s unparalleled excitement about seeing Affleck handle both ex Ana de Armas and snails, Deep Water just flat out isn\u2019t good enough to kick-start an erotic thrillersance. However, not even a laughably bad ending can slow down Affleck\u2019s current hot streak. Carrying some of his Gone Girl energy, Affleck stars as cuckold extraordinaire Vic Van Allen, a wealthy man who invented drone warfare and spends his days riding his bike and his nights killing his wife\u2019s young lovers. As we\u2019re repeatedly reminded, Vic is not a \u201cnormal guy,\u201d even though only Deep Water MVP runner-up Tracy Letts seems to be suspicious of him. Correctly deemed \u201cthe master of self-aware acting\u201d by The Ringer\u2019s Adam Nayman, Affleck, who apparently is also a snail whisperer, knows exactly what movie he\u2019s in and single-handedly makes Deep Water worth the time and conversation. \u201cIf you were married to someone else, you\u2019d be so fucking bored, you\u2019d kill yourself,\u201d Melinda (de Armas) tells Vic. That\u2019s interesting, because if Deep Water starred someone else, we\u2019d have been so fucking bored. Also, I challenge you to find a better, funnier, and more engaging hand-washing performance! 8. The Accountant, 2016 They had me at \u201cBen Affleck stars as an accountant/hitman in an action-thriller from Warrior director Gavin O\u2019Connor,\u201d and then they [spoiler alert] went and revealed that Jon Bernthal would play his rival hitman brother! I will happily accept a rumored sequel featuring the further adventures of those kids\u2014and that really says something, because this could have gone so wrong. The key part of The Accountant\u2019s premise I didn\u2019t already mention is that Christian Wolff has high-functioning autism, a condition deeply explored both in the present and through flashbacks to his upbringing. Credit to Affleck and O\u2019Connor for not falling into the usual trap of going too big, instead opting for more subtle touches\u2014all of which Affleck nails, from the mannerisms to the spot-on line deliveries. (I\u2019ve crunched the numbers and \u201cI have a pocket protector\u201d deserves its own tax exemption.) 7. Hollywoodland, 2006 If The Town was the real beginning of the Benaissance, then his unexpected\u2014and Golden Globe\u2013nominated\u2014turn as late Superman actor George Reeves was the soft launch. Following the downfall of the original Bennifer and the disastrous run of Daredevil, Gigli, Paycheck, Surviving Christmas, and Jersey Girl, Affleck didn\u2019t appear in a film for two years before returning with a supporting role in this neo-noir period drama about the circumstances surrounding Reeves\u2019s death. (Adrien Brody is top dog on the call sheet, which really puts things in perspective.) \u201cI was really unhappy finding myself perpetually in the sights of paparazzi cameras and in the gossip magazines,\u201d Affleck said at the time. \u201cThis character was broken, but he\u2019s also the archetype of all those kinds of guys I had played\u2014the actual, real version, which is damaged and somehow unhappy and trying to be something other than what he is.\u201d And similar to some of Affleck\u2019s other best work, you can see the real-life parallels between him and his character, whether it\u2019s as a reluctant superhero or feeling freer than ever after shedding the cape in hopes of being taken seriously as an actor. What a beautiful irony that Superman was the start of that successful mission for Affleck. 6. Boiler Room, 2000 The true test of movie stardom isn\u2019t just box office receipts and award nominations; it\u2019s also being able to pop in for five minutes and completely steal a movie. Affleck does just that with his three scenes in the criminally underseen Boiler Room, which also features the most 2000 cast of all time. (Affleck! Vin Diesel!! Jamie Kennedy!!! Giovanni Ribisi!!!! Scott Caan!!!!!) As iconic as this shot of Affleck in a Hustler hat and Trojan T-shirt is, the real reason to invest in his outing as Jim Young is the way the high-rolling stockbroker brings us and Ribisi\u2019s character into the world of finance and brokerage firms. \u201cAnybody tells you money\u2019s the root of all evil doesn\u2019t fucking have any,\u201d he proclaims with a macho arrogance that makes the line sing. \u201cThey say money can\u2019t buy happiness? Look at the fuckin\u2019 smile on my face. Ear to ear, baby!\u201d If you want that same smile, do yourself a favor and check out what will be the best five minutes of your day. That\u2019s my life advice. 5. The Town, 2010 While Affleck opted to stay behind the camera for his directorial debut, he graduated to double duty for his sophomore effort. As is often the case, Affleck doesn\u2019t have the shiniest part in one of his own films\u2014that distinction in The Town goes to Jeremy Renner, who chillingly portrays the violent and unpredictable Jem. But this first-rate heist film is held together by its protagonist, Affleck\u2019s Doug MacRay, an NHL washout who dreams of pulling off one last score with his crew. Affleck and Renner are an entertaining odd couple, with Affleck staying mostly steady and reserved throughout as Renner constantly explodes. But the writer-director saved a bit of spark for himself, namely in the spotlight scene of Doug unloading on Gem for saying he can\u2019t walk away. A spot in this top five was clinched the minute Doug threw down the gauntlet with, \u201cAll you give a fuck about is coke and Xbox.\u201d 4. The Last Duel, 2021 I don\u2019t care what Regina Hall says\u2014The Last Duel has fans! There are dozens of us! Here\u2019s my deeply scientific review of Ridley Scott\u2019s medieval epic: It fucking rocks. Alongside cowriter Nicole Holofcener, Affleck and Matt Damon finally reunited for their first script collaboration since Good Will Hunting, and smartly used the Rashomon storytelling device for the adaptation of this true tale of a knight (Damon) who challenges his friend (Adam Driver) to a duel after the former\u2019s wife (Jodie Comer) says the latter raped her. When the project was announced, it appeared that Affleck was set to face off with Damon in the Driver spot, but at some point a genius call was made to instead put Affleck in the scene-stealing, laugh-inducing supporting role of France\u2019s premier 14th century party boy, Count Pierre d\u2019Alen\u00e7on, who, in a nice meta twist, can\u2019t stand Damon\u2019s character. \u201cHe\u2019s no fucking fun,\u201d he says of Jean de Carrouges. Meanwhile, Count Pierre is all fucking fun, from the way he says the C-word to the way he greets Driver: \u201cCome in, take your pants off.\u201d In a 2021 Affleck performance duel, this easily defeats Tender Bar. 3. The Way Back, 2020 Affleck reunites with Gavin O\u2019Connor for this nontraditional basketball drama that had the unfortunate luck of being released the last weekend before the COVID-19 shutdowns began in earnest. Like in Triple Frontier, it\u2019s impossible to ignore the baggage Affleck brings to his performance as Jack Cunningham, a former high school standout who struggles with alcoholism until he\u2019s brought in to coach his alma mater. The Way Back was filmed in the wake of Affleck\u2019s public struggles with alcoholism, which is often top of mind when watching Jack throw back a beer in the shower or get dragged home from the bar. But credit to Affleck for never overplaying those moments. And as if those issues weren\u2019t enough, it\u2019s later revealed that Jack\u2019s marriage fell apart following the death of his son. \u201cI know that I failed you,\u201d he tells his ex-wife in an emotional sequence that in an ideal world would have been Affleck\u2019s Oscars clip. \u201cI failed our son, because I didn\u2019t take care of his mom. I hope one day you can see in me the man that you once hoped that I would be.\u201d Throughout the movie\u2019s near-two-hour running time, we see the actor that Hollywood hoped Affleck could be. It\u2019s promise fulfilled\u2014and reason to believe that the next 30 years of Affleck\u2019s career could surpass the last 30. 2. Good Will Hunting, 1997 Writing and starring in the underdog drama with Matt Damon was the official, noisy, Oscar-winning arrival for the longtime BFFs. The dramatic heft of Good Will Hunting rests on Damon and Robin Williams, but Affleck\u2019s Chuckie is responsible for two of the film\u2019s defining moments. He first showcases his comedic talents while posing as his genius best friend, Will, in a job interview and forever changing how we hear the word \u201cretainer.\u201d Of course, that pales in comparison to the legacy of Chuckie\u2019s \u201cthe best part of my day\u201d monologue, in which the blue-collar character reveals previously unseen layers. Damon appeared to get the bigger immediate bump from Good Will Hunting, scoring a Best Actor nomination and, for some strange reason, more of the creative credit, which now looks foolish following Affleck\u2019s rebirth as an elite filmmaker. And while the duo\u2019s careers went in very different directions afterward, there was no debating that two new A-listers had arrived in Hollywood. 1. Gone Girl, 2014 Just a year after his overall career peaked with Argo\u2019s Best Picture victory, Affleck reaches what is likely, so far, his movie-star peak. Think about it: He\u2019s the face of a critically acclaimed adult drama from one of Hollywood\u2019s great auteurs that makes almost $400 million. Rosamund Pike deserved the moment she had upon Gone Girl\u2019s release, but Affleck\u2019s performance has better stood the test of time. Affleck was so well cast as Nick Dunne that he was believable as both the cheating husband who probably killed his wife and the idiot husband who might have been framed for his wife\u2019s murder. And director David Fincher picked Affleck for a very specific reason, playing with his persona and celebrity in a way that I\u2019m not entirely sure Affleck was in on. Whether those elements were conscious in Affleck\u2019s approach or not, he should have joined Pike as an Oscar nominee. (Steve Carell in Foxcatcher? Really?)

            "full_description": "It\u2019s hard to find a movie star career that has been more of a roller coaster than that of Ben Affleck. Upon breaking through with an Oscar win in 1998 for writing Good Will Hunting , he and Matt Damon looked primed for a Hollywood takeover. But while Damon\u2019s been the model of consistency ever since, Affleck has managed to have as many highs as lows, navigating box office bombs, personal issues, and viral Dunkin\u2019 Donuts runs. But Affleck is thriving once again thanks to a pair of critically adored performances and the reboot of Bennifer. And yet, it wasn\u2019t so long ago that people were seriously putting Mark Wahlberg ahead of him in the Boston actor rankings. Part of what separates Affleck from the likes of Wahlberg and other A-list actors of their generation is that he never appears to be following a playbook or master plan; he\u2019s unpredictable. Now, that can lead both to pleasant surprises and disastrous misses. While Wahlberg is constantly either trying to launch his own franchise or find a new true story to tell, take a look through Affleck\u2019s filmography and attempt to find a through line or pattern\u2014no one with a methodical strategy plots out a two-year run of Daredevil , Gigli , Paycheck , Surviving Christmas , and Jersey Girl . And more recently, Affleck has gone against the industry\u2019s superhero and IP wave by becoming the movie star most invested in the adult drama, as evidenced by five of his six projects from 2020 and 2021. (Ironically, Zack Snyder\u2019s Justice League somehow was the only one deemed Oscar-worthy .) With the release of Deep Water \u2014the erotic thriller that neither Affleck nor Ana de Armas will ever acknowledge the existence of\u2014it\u2019s the right time to go full accountant and crunch the numbers to rank every single Affleck performance. To be clear, this will be an examination of the actor\u2019s performance, not the movies overall, which means Pearl Harbor \u2014as a very, very hypothetical example\u2014could be higher than expected! But most of all, assessing what Affleck has done with each of these performances should forever prove how baffling it is that this winner of Best Original Screenplay and Best Picture has never been nominated for an acting Oscar. Good hunting to us! Be prepared to hear a lot about Affleck\u2019s Razzie-winning 2003. In what should have been his Face/Off or Mission: Impossible II , Affleck gets saddled with post-U.S. peak John Woo and a movie that lacks any of the fun of the renowned action director\u2019s previous work. This clunky sci-fi flick stars Affleck as reverse engineer Michael Jennings, who is dealing with such high-security stuff that his memory must be wiped after each gig. Personally, I wish I could erase the memory of how bad the chemistry is between Affleck and his love interest, Uma Thurman, despite a pretty solid goodbye speech from Affleck as he\u2019s about to die. \u201cRemember me,\u201d he tells her, even if it\u2019s for the best that no one remembers Paycheck . Affleck\u2019s \u201cBasketball Player No. 10\u201d gets a single line: \u201cTake it, man,\u201d which he says when he\u2019s so scared by the literal werewolf guarding him that he just hands over the ball. He does do a decent job of looking terrified, so how could such a small, uncredited role be among his worst? Well: \u201cI went to the movie and I was like, \u2018That is not my voice. That is not me,\u2019\u201d Affleck admitted in 2020 . \u201cApparently [director Fran Rubel Kuzui] hated my performance so much that she looped the entire performance, which was one line. But, yes, I am dubbed in English!\u201d It\u2019s impressive that his career wasn\u2019t slayed right then. It speaks volumes that the sole animated film on Affleck\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is so low on this list. But maybe it shouldn\u2019t be surprising considering this biblical musical was the only DreamWorks Animation production to go straight to DVD until Trollhunters: Rise of the Titans joined the not-so-illustrious club in 2021. In the adaptation of the Book of Genesis, Affleck voices Jacob\u2019s chosen son, Joseph, but all you can hear is Ben Affleck trying to read the bible. And in this (74-minute!!) musical, Affleck doesn\u2019t even handle the singing, which there is a lot of. With so little for him to do, it\u2019s clear he was just dreaming of a nice, easy paycheck. Back-to-back straight-to-DVD releases! King of Dreams \u2019 lack of a theatrical release can\u2019t really be pinned on Affleck, who at the time still felt like the next big thing. But the fate of writer-director Mike Binder\u2019s embarrassingly bad dramedy says a lot about how out in the wilderness Affleck was at this point in his career. Starring opposite the very straight-to-DVD cast of Jerry O\u2019Connell, Rebecca Romijn, Bai Ling, and Hitch star Amber Valletta, Affleck is a douchey talent agent who takes up journaling as his personal and professional lives begin to fall apart. Often left to just mope around, it\u2019s unclear what the appeal of the role was for Affleck\u2014and don\u2019t even get us started on the wild dentist-surgery sequence that leaves him with some of the worst fake teeth in cinema history. Man About Town is such a miss that you couldn\u2019t have blamed Affleck if he was worried that using \u201ctown\u201d in the title of another movie would invite bad juju. Where to start with this semi-watchable mess? Maybe with the fact that pre\u2013 Fast & Furious Vin Diesel left the project due to issues with the script. Or maybe that this Christmas-themed crime film was released in February. Or maybe with Affleck\u2019s over-his-head criminal going by two names: Rudy and Nick. On the nose much? Here\u2019s hoping one day we get the Ben and Charlize Theron collaboration that we actually deserve. Speaking of terrible character names: Larry Gigli. Really? Well, he does keep reminding us that it rhymes with \u201creally,\u201d as in, \u201cYes, his name really is Larry Gigli.\u201d This infamous bomb not only almost ended Affleck\u2019s run as a movie star, it also seemed to end his engagement to costar Jennifer Lopez, who postponed their wedding only a month after the $4 million opening of this $75 million Razzie darling. Thankfully, both Affleck\u2019s career and his relationship with J.Lo eventually earned a renaissance, but the film\u2019s reputation as one of the worst ever made (according to Richard Roeper) is well-earned between Affleck\u2019s weird attempt at a mobster voice and this Larry Gigli monologue that belongs in the cringe hall of fame: \u201cLet me tell you who the fuck I am. I am the fucking sultan of slick, Sadie. I am the rule of fucking cool. You want to be a gangster, you want to be a thug, you just sit at my fucking feet and gather the pearls that emanate forth from me. Because I\u2019m the fuckin\u2019 original, straight-first-foremost, pimp-mack fuckin\u2019 hustler, original gangster\u2019s gangster.\u201d And yet I don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite as bad as its reputation. If it wasn\u2019t caught up in the Bennifer PR machine, it probably would\u2019ve just been a forgotten miss. I guess love can cost something . In his last role before his breakout, Affleck leads this little-seen raunchy comedy as impending college graduate Jack Freeman, who wears dog tags, runs around shirtless in jeans after getting kicked off a city bus, and says things like, \u201cThe pimp jacket is tits, dude\u2014what\u2019s the stress factor?\u201d But shout-out to the casting director for somehow getting Affleck, Sam Rockwell, Brendan Fraser, Leah Remini, French Stewart, Matthew McConaughey, and a blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-him Matt Damon in a movie that there\u2019s no chance you\u2019ve ever seen. Affleck\u2019s frequent collaborator Kevin Smith proved to be out of his element with this dramedy that briefly reunited the star with J.Lo shortly after the Gigli catastrophe and their breakup. Bad timing alert! Affleck goes full dick-mode as jerk publicist Ollie Trink\u00e9, who is forced to soften following the death of his wife (Lopez) in childbirth. This allows for plenty of dramatic beats for Affleck, some of which he pulls off better than others. Bonus points, though, for 2004 Will Smith\u2014the world\u2019s biggest movie star\u2014showing up as himself to declare that he\u2019s \u201cridiculously\u201d hung and deliver the sentimental parenting speech that moves Ollie to give up his corporate dreams in favor of being the best father possible. (If someone isn\u2019t already hard at work on Jersey Girl 2 , in which Ollie has only 20 minutes to help Smith revise his Oscar speech after he slaps someone onstage, then what are we even doing?) Pearl Harbor , a reminder that Affleck and Josh Hartnett were considered to be at the same level at one point and that someone thought it would be a good idea for Michael Bay to direct a three-hour movie about one of the darkest days in U.S. history. The king Roger Ebert sums it up like only he could: \u201cIts centerpiece is 40 minutes of redundant special effects, surrounded by a love story of stunning banality. The film has been directed without grace, vision, or originality, and although you may walk out quoting lines of dialogue, it will not be because you admire them.\u201d In that stunningly banal love triangle that also includes Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale, Affleck plays Rafe McCawley, a dyslexic military pilot. Affleck sure looks like a movie star here, but he rarely gets the chance to prove he is one, as every character moment feels like it\u2019s just biding time for Bay to go Full Bay. On paper, this critically panned political thriller should have been a slam dunk due to the presence of Affleck and Anne Hathaway, source material from esteemed writer Joan Didion, and direction from up-and-coming filmmaker Dee Rees ( Mudbound ). But the result was a 5 percent score on Rotten Tomatoes, a Razzie nom for Hathaway, and a film released on Netflix in February 2020 that couldn\u2019t even find an audience at a time when the world was pining for anything half-interesting to watch. Affleck must have been drawn in by Rees and Hathaway, because his character, State Department official Treat Morrison, sure wasn\u2019t it. Affleck is extremely overqualified for what\u2019s on the page and the roughly 15 minutes of screen time he has\u2014basically getting paid well to be on a poster and help make a lackluster twist feel impactful. Affleck\u2019s take on the blind vigilante lawyer Matt Murdock was one of the first misses in the pre-MCU superhero era that included hit franchises like Spider-Man, X-Men, and Blade. And Charlie Cox\u2019s Daredevil later becoming the most beloved character in Netflix\u2019s short-lived Marvel TV Universe hasn\u2019t helped the lasting memory of the original big-screen version. Affleck proves capable of handling the action and fight sequences, but the theme of him having to play straight man opposite scenery-chewing costars continues (Colin Farrell and Michael Clarke Duncan are both going for it in the best way). After a tepid response (even Affleck has called it \u201csilly\u201d) and a canceled sequel, Affleck appeared to forever swear off superheroes \u2026 at least until he looked up and saw the signal. Outside of getting to hang with BFF Matt Damon, future Good Will Hunting pal Cole Hauser, 1992 hotshot Chris O\u2019Donnell, and no. 1 on the call sheet Brendan Fraser, there\u2019s not much for Affleck to do in his film debut besides be a pretty convincing antisemite named Chesty Smith. Props to Affleck for staying true to his character\u2019s name and going shirtless in a scene in which a bunch of (otherwise fully clothed) boys are horsing around together! This kicks off a run of glorified Affleck cameos on our list. For his two scenes as Arkansas lawyer Lawrence Bowen, Affleck is paired with Jamie Lee Curtis as Lawrence\u2019s wife and law partner, Elaine. The duo\u2019s presence and bickering is random, unnecessary to the plot, and also the high point of the small film from writer-director-star Billy Bob Thornton. Credited as the dim-witted and flirtatious \u201cBartender,\u201d Affleck floats in the background as people like Paul Rudd, Kate Hudson, and Courtney Love take center stage. He eventually gets to expertly deliver some deliciously lame pickup lines, like, \u201cMy clothes and those clothes would look good on my floor,\u201d and \u201cHow do you like your eggs in the morning: scrambled or fertilized?\u201d But what a historic missed opportunity to have a movie called 200 Cigarettes and not have the prince of paparazzi smoking shots take a drag! Again, Affleck is simply and appropriately named, this time in Kevin Smith\u2019s hangout sequel as \u201cGawking Guy.\u201d He gets only one line but he nails the \u201cgawking\u201d when his fast-food order is interrupted by an employee\u2019s fianc\u00e9e walking in, climbing on the counter, and making out with them. Also, you have to respect the facial hair choice . After debuting in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (stay tuned!), Affleck returned a few months later as the Caped Crusader to help launch the supervillain team-up and DC Extended Universe. Brief flashbacks first reveal Batman\u2019s role in capturing Deadshot (Will Smith) and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), and then a mid-credits scene between Bruce Wayne and Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) paves the way for Justice League . Not much to brag about there, but, as you\u2019ll come to see, I\u2019m higher on Batfleck than most. Affleck isn\u2019t the first, and he won\u2019t be the last, to win an Oscar and then follow it up with a bomb. (Please skip Bright 2 , Will Smith.) Here, the high was the Best Picture victory for Argo , and the low was the release soon thereafter of the film that finally made Hollywood admit that Justin Timberlake isn\u2019t a movie star. For a project about gambling and money, you couldn\u2019t have asked for better writers than Rounders and Billions masterminds Brian Koppelman and David Levien, but the trouble started on set (director Brad Furman lost control of the movie and wanted his name taken off) and not even a Hail Mary from Affleck and his Oscar-winning Argo editor could save it after filming ended. However, Affleck is far from the problem onscreen, getting to mix it up and go big as Ivan Block, a villain who enjoys giving steam-room speeches about Napoleon and feeding his enemies to crocodiles. Back in 2013, EW \u2019s Darren Franich correctly bet that Affleck would emerge mostly unscathed: \u201cFor Affleck, Runner Runner is a minor dark note in a bright phase of his career, notable mainly because it feels beamed in from an alternate universe where Affleck never staged a comeback and stars in movies like Runner Runner .\u201d \u201cAffleck was the bomb in Phantoms !\u201d While I can\u2019t go as far as that wall-breaking declaration made by Holden McNeil (Affleck) in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back , Affleck\u2019s Sheriff Bryce Hammond is an effective horror movie hero, thanks to his killing of the deadly creature and relaying of the quintessential monster-flick line, \u201cSend everyone!\u201d Buried between Affleck\u2019s memorable 1997 one-two punch of Chasing Amy and Good Will Hunting was a film that is almost impossible to find. (Thank you to Casa Video in Tucson, Arizona, for making sure I could complete this full ranking!) It felt right to place Going All the Way next to Phantoms \u2014even if Jay of Jay and Silent Bob did not also deem Affleck \u201cthe bomb\u201d in this small indie. Affleck is serviceable in the sidekick role as Tom \u201cGunner\u201d Casselman, a veteran of the Korean War who takes a shy former high school classmate (future Lost star Jeremy Davies) under his wing. Rachel Weisz, Rose McGowan, Lesley Ann Warren, and Affleck are all predictably stellar when given the opportunity, but this is Davies\u2019s movie, for better or for worse. Surely, many of you are asking, \u201cHow can a critically savaged film that only made back a third of its budget and earned Affleck his latest Razzie nom and capped an all-time disastrous two years for him ( Daredevil , Gigli , Paycheck , Jersey Girl , Surviving Christmas ) be this far from the bottom?\u201d I will admit that Surviving Christmas is as bad as you\u2019d expect a movie from the director of Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo to be. But! It\u2019s genuinely impressive how committed Affleck is to going off his rocker as advertising exec and classic rich guy jackass Drew Latham, who, when left alone for the holidays, pays the occupants of his childhood home to pretend to be his family. This psychopath instantly embraces this fake reality to an alarming degree, making this the closest Affleck will ever get to remaking Big . I\u2019m not saying the movie should be added to your annual Christmas viewing rotation, but you\u2019d at least survive a single watch. There\u2019s only so much to say about Affleck in Terrence Malick\u2019s predictably polarizing experimental drama, because there\u2019s only so much Affleck gets to say. While there\u2019s minimal dialogue in the entire film (the last reviewed by Ebert before his death; he gave it 3.5 stars ), it\u2019s especially true for Affleck, whose fleeting lines almost always come in the background as the scenes focus on other stars (Olga Kurylenko, Rachel McAdams, and Javier Bardem). Despite that, Affleck is both never distracting and someone you can\u2019t look away from. And the opportunity paid off in other ways for Affleck, who has said he kept a watchful eye on Malick before heading off to direct Argo . Affleck, McAdams, Russell Crowe, and Helen Mirren starred in this solid but unspectacular adaptation of the hit 2003 British series. But this is Crowe\u2019s show, with Affleck in supporting position as clean-cut congressman Stephen Collins, who calls on his former college roommate (Crowe), now an investigative reporter, when an aide he was having an affair with is killed. As credible as Affleck is in his scenes opposite Crowe, once again his presence seems to be in service of an inevitable and predictable twist. This movie is so universally hated that Warner Bros. was cyberbullied into giving Zack Snyder $100 million more to make a longer, slightly improved version. But I\u2019ll forever contend that Affleck is a good Batman/Bruce Wayne and could have been a great one under better circumstances and a different (I don\u2019t want to be bullied online, so I won\u2019t say \u201cbetter\u201d) director. There are some nice flashes (entering the speed force) here from Affleck, especially when it comes to delivering one-liners, but the comedy ceiling is only so high in such a dark world. When I\u2019m on my deathbed, I\u2019ll look back at all that I could have accomplished if I hadn\u2019t spent a total of eight hours watching two separate iterations of Zack Snyder\u2019s pandemic hobby. But Affleck\u2019s performance in this version benefits from more time devoted to the chemistry between Affleck and Gal Gadot and the new post-apocalyptic batshit dynamic between Affleck and Jared Leto. That dream sequence in which the Joker talks about giving Batman a \u201creach-around\u201d and Batman drops an F-bomb might be the most interesting either of those actors was allowed to be in those roles. Wait, did I just talk myself into another four hours of Zack Snyder Batman content?! This Affleck and Sandra Bullock rom-com\u2014that for some reason is shot like Traffic and opens with a horny grandpa having a stripper-induced heart attack at a bachelor party\u2014coasts on the charisma of its young stars, even if they lack romantic chemistry. The high point of blurb writer Ben and bagel shop owner Sarah\u2019s road trip is at a gay bar where Affleck loosens up and unleashes a striptease that forces you to picture a world in which he had taken on the Matthew McConaughey role in Magic Mike . Maybe he can still get in on the Last Dance ? If you ever need a reminder of how big Entourage and Ari Gold became, watch Jeremy Piven be the catalyst for the events of a movie that features Affleck, Ryan Reynolds, Chris Pine, Taraji P. Henson, Common, Joel Edgerton, Andy Garcia, Alicia Keys, Jason Bateman, and Ray Liotta. Affleck\u2019s bail bondsman Jack Dupree is initially positioned as a major player, introducing Piven\u2019s magician/wannabe gangster to his cohorts and the audience. And he looks cool doing it, with a cigarette (take that, 200 Cigarettes !), a handlebar mustache, and a kegel hat. Too bad it\u2019s short-lived: Pine\u2019s neo-Nazi shockingly takes Dupree out only 31 minutes in, setting the table for the blood bath that is to come. In the year of our lord 2002, Affleck was starring opposite Samuel L. Jackson, taking over for Harrison Ford as Jack Ryan \u2026 and playing fourth fiddle to Luke Wilson, Denise Richards, and someone named Jay Lacopo in a straight-to-DVD comedy about a houseless man terrorizing a first date. As you\u2019d hope for his sake, Affleck is the best part of this straight-to-DVD comedy: As Michael, the supportive work friend of Wilson\u2019s Stanley, Affleck is a great hype man, riling up his \u201cmad dog\u201d to ask out Richards\u2019s Diana. And it\u2019s when Michael\u2019s following Stanley and Diana to ensure things go well that Affleck finds his own comedy gold with none other than a pre-fame Melissa McCarthy. Out of nowhere, the two end up going at it like animals on a motorcycle, with Michael declaring, \u201cI always wanted to get my swerve on on my bike!\u201d Honestly, if the movie had steered into that direction earlier, it might have at least gotten a limited theatrical release. As I just mentioned, when Affleck wasn\u2019t slumming it in 2002, he was also picking up the Jack Ryan mantle and following in the footsteps of Ford and Alec Baldwin. Related side note: Does every white movie star get a turn playing Jack Ryan? Also, why does every white movie star want to play Jack Ryan? There\u2019s an argument to be made that Jack Ryan feels so \u201990s that it should have stayed there, a stance backed up by the fact that none of the movies or series centered on him in the past two decades have made any real impact. More than Ford, Affleck does possess the \u201cNo, I\u2019m an analyst, I can\u2019t do field work\u201d greenness that is such a part of the Ryan mystique. But in the end, The Sum of All Fears is the definition of a middle-of-the-road film, which makes it a natural fit for this positioning. Have I mentioned that I\u2019m pro-Batfleck? Affleck was riding high on his comeback after Argo \u2019s win for Best Picture, and his decision to play Batman was the ultimate heat check. Now, you could argue that heat check went up in flames, but it wasn\u2019t all bad. I\u2019m convinced there\u2019s a quality movie in Batman v Superman , especially the first half. The Affleck and Gal Gadot chemistry is crackling from the jump, while the out-of-costume not-so meet-cute for Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent (Henry Cavill), aided by Jesse Eisenberg\u2019s bananas Lex Luthor interpretation, shows promise that is never fulfilled. And that\u2019s more than we can say for Clooney! Opposite then-girlfriend Gwyneth Paltrow, Affleck takes on a supporting role in one of his first post\u2013 Good Will Hunting films. He doesn\u2019t show up until more than 30 minutes into the controversial Best Picture winner, but when he does, it\u2019s a welcomed sight, both for the audience and the characters. As 16th-century actor Ned Alleyn, Affleck brings a bit of swagger that has you wishing that this was either Ned in Love , or that Affleck was in the Billy Shakespeare spot (sorry not sorry, Joey Fiennes!). Affleck\u2019s debut as a \u201cmovie star\u201d\u2014which came months after his Good Will Hunting Oscar\u2014proved to be the mixed bag that most Michael Bay vehicles are. The highest-grossing film released in 1998, which had nine writers work on the script (J.J. Abrams and Tony Gilroy among them), was destroyed by critics and earned seven Razzie noms, including one for on-screen couple Affleck and Liv Tyler. That being said, Armageddon is exactly what you\u2019d want from a Michael Bay space movie. And in a cast stacked with veteran stars and character actors, Affleck handles himself well, coming across like the IT actor of the moment that he was. And don\u2019t think we didn\u2019t consider giving his commentary on the Armageddon DVD its own spot on this list! You won\u2019t want to miss a thing when it comes to his performance there. Let\u2019s be clear: Affleck\u2019s last directorial effort to date isn\u2019t bad, but it also definitely isn\u2019t Gone Baby Gone , The Town , or Argo . Variety \u2019s Owen Gleiberman hit it on the head in his review : \u201cIt\u2019s like seeing the ghost of a terrific movie: All the pieces are in place, yet as you\u2019re watching it, there doesn\u2019t seem to be quite enough there.\u201d Following the critical and commercial success of the aforementioned three films, there were high expectations for Affleck writing, directing, and starring in a prohibition-era gangster film based on a book from Gone Baby Gone and Shutter Island author Dennis Lehane. Unfortunately, instead of another home run, it was more of a soft single through the infield. As always, Affleck is solid at the center of his own movie, this time as WWI veteran turned bootlegger Joe Coughlin. But, unlike in his other outings, there\u2019s no scene-stealing supporting turns to help carry the load, and for most of the movie, Affleck is dressed like Lou Bega. It seems reasonable to think the mixed response and financial loss of Live by Night is part of the reason he\u2019s still yet to return behind the camera. Thanks to the alphabet, Affleck gets top billing in this star-studded romantic dramedy, despite probably having the least amount of screen time of the A-list cast. But it doesn\u2019t matter, because he comes off as extremely likable as the marriage-opposed Neil, which speaks completely to the aura of Affleck (given that Neil\u2019s lone distinguishing characteristic is his stance on marriage). A rewatch also serves as a reminder that his scene partners are Jennifer Aniston and Bradley Cooper, both of whom we\u2019d pay to see him reunite with. Just imagine an Affleck and Cooper buddy comedy, with them portraying 21st-century versions of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. Kevin Smith\u2019s cult classic marks Affleck\u2019s entrance into the View Askewniverse. Before being upgraded to a Smith lead, he plays Shannon Hamilton, the scumbag manager at the mall\u2019s Fashionable Male clothing store and romantic rival to Jason Lee\u2019s main character. Affleck\u2019s limited screen time is a positive addition, even as his character leaves a disgusting impression due to a late film reveal. And clearly Affleck and Smith left an impression on each other, as it\u2019s still the most substantial ongoing collaborative relationship Affleck has had with a filmmaker not named Ben Affleck. Reprising his role as Chasing Amy \u2019s Holden McNeil, Affleck rejoined the View Askewniverse after 13 years away. Now a podcaster, Holden is reunited with Jay and Silent Bob at Chronic-Con, where it\u2019s revealed he fathered a daughter with Alyssa (Joey Lauren Adams). It\u2019s a five-minute sequence about fatherhood that works as a nostalgia-fueled blend of earnestness, sentimentality, and winking at the camera, with references to almost a dozen other Affleck movies. Did we need Jay and Silent Bob back in our lives? Probably not, but at least we got Affleck saying this to his movie daughter: \u201cThey\u2019re gone, girl. They\u2019re on the town. It\u2019s just us. We\u2019re the just us league. What are you looking at me like that for? You\u2019re like, ar, go fuck yourself.\u201d Featuring Jason Bateman, Kristen Wiig, Mila Kunis, J.K. Simmons, and a very game Affleck, this comedy from Office Space writer-director Mike Judge doesn\u2019t quite live up to its talented cast. In one of his rare non\u2013Kevin Smith funnyman roles, Affleck is Extract \u2019s secret weapon as Dean Slade, the bar-owning, weed-smoking, shaggy-hair-having, free-spirited best friend to Bateman\u2019s uptight lead character. He\u2019s the kind of guy who suggests you hire a gigolo to have sex with your wife and then asks for his cut (\u201cI don\u2019t think they call it a pimp when it\u2019s a male prostitue,\u201d he argues). Judge greatly misjudged the decision to essentially sideline Affleck for the second half of the film. Affleck has plenty of experience working with past, present, and future romantic partners, yet that real-life chemistry often doesn\u2019t translate to the screen. But the best of such instances was his reunion with Shakespeare in Love costar and on-again, off-again girlfriend Gwyneth Paltrow in Bounce . Affleck stars as Buddy Amaral, a playboy advertising exec (were there any other kind in this era of movies?) whose life goes on a downward spiral after a plane that he was supposed to be on crashes. This fact is unbeknownst to Abby, the widow of the man who took Buddy\u2019s seat. After checking in on her, Buddy eventually starts a relationship with Abby. This is an extremely gross premise, but the strong chemistry with Paltrow, some solid monologues, and Affleck\u2019s character doing a dry run of Jackson Maine at an awards show make Bounce worth revisiting. It\u2019s very possible that you\u2019ve never seen The Company Men , or even heard of it. Sandwiched between the smashes The Town and Argo , this modestly budgeted recession drama from writer-director John Wells ( ER , Shameless ) was released to little fanfare. Surrounded by grumpy elder statesmen like Kevin Costner, Chris Cooper, Craig T. Nelson, and Tommy Lee Jones, Affleck livens the action up as Bobby Walker, a self-proclaimed \u201c37-year-old unemployed loser who can\u2019t support his family.\u201d The transition from successful white collar businessman to rookie construction worker allows Affleck a few impassioned moments that help elevate the film and performance. Plus, you can never go wrong with Masshole Affleck. Respect to Kevin Smith for deciding to completely ignore continuity in his View Askewniverse, as Strike Back finds Affleck playing both himself and Holden McNeil, while his Chasing Amy partner Jason Lee is playing his character from Mallrats . Trust us, don\u2019t think too hard about it. Early on, Holden shows up to teach Jay and Silent Bob about the internet and shout out Affleck being, as previously alluded to, \u201cthe bomb in Phantoms .\u201d The titular duo then arrive in Hollywood where Matt Damon and a frosted-tipped Affleck are shooting Good Will Hunting 2: Hunting Season . It\u2019s possible that the longtime collaborators have never had more fun than in this scene , which ends with Affleck gleefully saying the cops aren\u2019t there to arrest him because he wasn\u2019t with a sex worker \u2026 that day . We definitely liked that applesauce, Ben. Did someone mention Damon and Affleck having a ball in a Smith movie? The highest-grossing release of the filmmaker\u2019s career to that point starred the recent Oscar winners as expletive-dropping fallen angels Loki and Bartleby , who have been banished from Heaven for insubordination. The controversial film finds the pair getting into some rowdy shenanigans, only for Affleck\u2019s Bartleby to take a late dark turn, killing Damon\u2019s Loki for losing faith. Bartleby\u2019s wings are soon shot off, prompting a delirious laugh that is also downright angelic. Our Smith-Affleck run in the rankings ends where Affleck\u2019s leading man career begin in earnest. You could say the whole concept of Smith\u2019s well-received rom-com has aged poorly, but even then, his treatment of queer sexuality seemed poorly handled. That aside, Affleck, Jason Lee, and the Golden Globe\u2013nominated Joey Lauren Adams, who it still feels like should have been the true breakout here, are all excellent. While Lee dominates the comedy, Affleck and Adams\u2014as comic book artists Holden McNeil and Alyssa Jones\u2014deliver the romance and drama. In some of the heaviest scenes to ever be featured in a Smith film, Affleck shines, whether it be in his confession of love (which turns into an argument and then a rainy makeout session) or as he quietly sheds a tear post-breakup. No wonder producers and studios were chasing Affleck after this. You know who thinks this is too low? Matt Damon! For EW \u2019s March 2022 cover, Damon interviewed Affleck and shared his five favorite performances from his BFF , which unexpectedly included this thriller. But it\u2019s not a surprise to those who have seen Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson\u2019s two-hander that begins with a car crash and evolves into a tale of revenge, redemption, and ethical dilemmas. As Wall Street attorney Gavin Banek, Affleck is again a rich douche, and his sleazy handling of an accident with Jackson\u2019s character leads to a fire and rage from both actors\u2014old hat for Jackson, but surprising and welcome from Affleck. The no. 1 testament to how incredibly watchable Affleck is as bar owner Charlie McGuire/father figure Uncle Charlie in George Clooney\u2019s coming-of-age drama is that I had zero interest in anything going on when he wasn\u2019t around. And only part of that was thanks to this true and necessary quote: \u201cUncle Charlie says the Yankees are assholes.\u201d Clooney the director would have turned in another boring, buzz-free movie if it weren\u2019t for Affleck\u2019s breezy, charming performance as the ultimate cool, sage uncle, for which he recently earned SAG and Golden Globe nominations only to come up shy of landing his first acting Oscar nod. Matthew McConaughey as Wooderson is the performance that has endured from Richard Linklater\u2019s beloved high school flick, but Affleck leaves the first memorable mark of his career as paddle-wielding bully Fred O\u2019Bannion, who takes a bit too much joy in spanking eighth graders. \u201cBen was smart and full of life,\u201d recalled Linklater of young Affleck. \u201cYou don\u2019t cast the unappealing person, you cast the appealing person.\u201d And it doesn\u2019t get more appealing than watching O\u2019Bannion get his comeuppance when he\u2019s lured into a setup that ends with white paint being dumped all over him. It leads to an all-time \u201closing your shit\u201d reaction from Affleck, so much so that it\u2019s extremely confusing that O\u2019Bannion is never seen again. It\u2019s interesting that, for what is likely his career pinnacle, Affleck\u2019s acting is almost never mentioned. That\u2019s understandable considering his Golden Globe win for Best Director and the film\u2019s Best Picture victory at the Oscars, but Affleck\u2019s turn as CIA exfiltration specialist Tony Mendez shouldn\u2019t be ignored\u2014and we\u2019re not just talking about his great \u201970s look. While the part is more subdued and less flashy than the Academy is usually inclined to recognize, Affleck is a steady guide through this world and provides himself with a couple of meaty, quotable sequences. One example: when he assures the nervous diplomats whom he\u2019s come to save that, \u201cThis is what I do. I get people out\u2014and I\u2019ve never left anyone behind.\u201d You can\u2019t not love a classic \u201cthis is what I do\u201d monologue! Netflix\u2019s heist-survival film was in the works for almost a decade, with seemingly every male star of a certain age attached at one point. In the end, the cameras rolled with the peak alpha-male group of Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnam, Pedro Pascal, and Garrett Hedlund. Affleck plays the band of brothers\u2019 washed-up former captain, Tom \u201cRedfly\u201d Davis. After initially leaving the film for personal reasons, Affleck returned to the role\u2014and it seemed like his troubles came with him. ( The infamous phoenix back tattoo photo was taken during this production.) But Affleck\u2019s sad-sack nature and burgeoning beer gut played perfectly into the character and performance. Redfly, the same guy who was the hardest to convince to take the mission, is the one who gets greedy when they find more money than expected at a drug lord\u2019s house, setting up the unfortunate events to come. But before tragedy strikes, Affleck makes you feel Redfly\u2019s \u201cgetting too old for this shit\u201d schtick while also making you understand why these other guys would follow him across a mountain that\u2019s difficult for horses to navigate. Even I can\u2019t believe this cracked the top 10! So much (like soooo much ) has already been written about Unfaithful director Adrian Lyne\u2019s long-awaited return\u2014and I\u2019ve happily read it all. Sadly, despite the internet\u2019s unparalleled excitement about seeing Affleck handle both ex Ana de Armas and snails, Deep Water just flat out isn\u2019t good enough to kick-start an erotic thrillersance. However, not even a laughably bad ending can slow down Affleck\u2019s current hot streak. Carrying some of his Gone Girl energy, Affleck stars as cuckold extraordinaire Vic Van Allen, a wealthy man who invented drone warfare and spends his days riding his bike and his nights killing his wife\u2019s young lovers. As we\u2019re repeatedly reminded, Vic is not a \u201cnormal guy,\u201d even though only Deep Water MVP runner-up Tracy Letts seems to be suspicious of him. Correctly deemed \u201cthe master of self-aware acting\u201d by The Ringer \u2019s Adam Nayman, Affleck, who apparently is also a snail whisperer , knows exactly what movie he\u2019s in and single-handedly makes Deep Water worth the time and conversation. \u201cIf you were married to someone else, you\u2019d be so fucking bored, you\u2019d kill yourself,\u201d Melinda (de Armas) tells Vic. That\u2019s interesting, because if Deep Water starred someone else, we\u2019d have been so fucking bored. Also, I challenge you to find a better, funnier, and more engaging hand-washing performance ! They had me at \u201cBen Affleck stars as an accountant/hitman in an action-thriller from Warrior director Gavin O\u2019Connor,\u201d and then they [ spoiler alert ] went and revealed that Jon Bernthal would play his rival hitman brother! I will happily accept a rumored sequel featuring the further adventures of those kids\u2014and that really says something, because this could have gone so wrong. The key part of The Accountant \u2019s premise I didn\u2019t already mention is that Christian Wolff has high-functioning autism, a condition deeply explored both in the present and through flashbacks to his upbringing. Credit to Affleck and O\u2019Connor for not falling into the usual trap of going too big, instead opting for more subtle touches\u2014all of which Affleck nails, from the mannerisms to the spot-on line deliveries. (I\u2019ve crunched the numbers and \u201cI have a pocket protector\u201d deserves its own tax exemption.) If The Town was the real beginning of the Benaissance, then his unexpected\u2014and Golden Globe\u2013nominated\u2014turn as late Superman actor George Reeves was the soft launch. Following the downfall of the original Bennifer and the disastrous run of Daredevil , Gigli , Paycheck , Surviving Christmas , and Jersey Girl , Affleck didn\u2019t appear in a film for two years before returning with a supporting role in this neo-noir period drama about the circumstances surrounding Reeves\u2019s death. (Adrien Brody is top dog on the call sheet, which really puts things in perspective.) \u201cI was really unhappy finding myself perpetually in the sights of paparazzi cameras and in the gossip magazines,\u201d Affleck said at the time. \u201cThis character was broken, but he\u2019s also the archetype of all those kinds of guys I had played\u2014the actual, real version, which is damaged and somehow unhappy and trying to be something other than what he is.\u201d And similar to some of Affleck\u2019s other best work, you can see the real-life parallels between him and his character, whether it\u2019s as a reluctant superhero or feeling freer than ever after shedding the cape in hopes of being taken seriously as an actor. What a beautiful irony that Superman was the start of that successful mission for Affleck. The true test of movie stardom isn\u2019t just box office receipts and award nominations; it\u2019s also being able to pop in for five minutes and completely steal a movie. Affleck does just that with his three scenes in the criminally underseen Boiler Room , which also features the most 2000 cast of all time. (Affleck! Vin Diesel!! Jamie Kennedy!!! Giovanni Ribisi!!!! Scott Caan!!!!!) As iconic as this shot of Affleck in a Hustler hat and Trojan T-shirt is, the real reason to invest in his outing as Jim Young is the way the high-rolling stockbroker brings us and Ribisi\u2019s character into the world of finance and brokerage firms. \u201cAnybody tells you money\u2019s the root of all evil doesn\u2019t fucking have any,\u201d he proclaims with a macho arrogance that makes the line sing. \u201cThey say money can\u2019t buy happiness? Look at the fuckin\u2019 smile on my face. Ear to ear, baby!\u201d If you want that same smile, do yourself a favor and check out what will be the best five minutes of your day. That\u2019s my life advice. While Affleck opted to stay behind the camera for his directorial debut, he graduated to double duty for his sophomore effort. As is often the case, Affleck doesn\u2019t have the shiniest part in one of his own films\u2014that distinction in The Town goes to Jeremy Renner, who chillingly portrays the violent and unpredictable Jem. But this first-rate heist film is held together by its protagonist, Affleck\u2019s Doug MacRay, an NHL washout who dreams of pulling off one last score with his crew. Affleck and Renner are an entertaining odd couple, with Affleck staying mostly steady and reserved throughout as Renner constantly explodes. But the writer-director saved a bit of spark for himself, namely in the spotlight scene of Doug unloading on Gem for saying he can\u2019t walk away. A spot in this top five was clinched the minute Doug threw down the gauntlet with, \u201cAll you give a fuck about is coke and Xbox.\u201d I don\u2019t care what Regina Hall says\u2014 The Last Duel has fans! There are dozens of us! Here\u2019s my deeply scientific review of Ridley Scott\u2019s medieval epic: It fucking rocks. Alongside cowriter Nicole Holofcener, Affleck and Matt Damon finally reunited for their first script collaboration since Good Will Hunting , and smartly used the Rashomon storytelling device for the adaptation of this true tale of a knight (Damon) who challenges his friend (Adam Driver) to a duel after the former\u2019s wife (Jodie Comer) says the latter raped her. When the project was announced, it appeared that Affleck was set to face off with Damon in the Driver spot, but at some point a genius call was made to instead put Affleck in the scene-stealing, laugh-inducing supporting role of France\u2019s premier 14th century party boy, Count Pierre d\u2019Alen\u00e7on, who, in a nice meta twist, can\u2019t stand Damon\u2019s character. \u201cHe\u2019s no fucking fun,\u201d he says of Jean de Carrouges. Meanwhile, Count Pierre is all fucking fun, from the way he says the C-word to the way he greets Driver: \u201cCome in, take your pants off.\u201d In a 2021 Affleck performance duel, this easily defeats Tender Bar . Affleck reunites with Gavin O\u2019Connor for this nontraditional basketball drama that had the unfortunate luck of being released the last weekend before the COVID-19 shutdowns began in earnest. Like in Triple Frontier , it\u2019s impossible to ignore the baggage Affleck brings to his performance as Jack Cunningham, a former high school standout who struggles with alcoholism until he\u2019s brought in to coach his alma mater. The Way Back was filmed in the wake of Affleck\u2019s public struggles with alcoholism, which is often top of mind when watching Jack throw back a beer in the shower or get dragged home from the bar. But credit to Affleck for never overplaying those moments. And as if those issues weren\u2019t enough, it\u2019s later revealed that Jack\u2019s marriage fell apart following the death of his son. \u201cI know that I failed you,\u201d he tells his ex-wife in an emotional sequence that in an ideal world would have been Affleck\u2019s Oscars clip. \u201cI failed our son, because I didn\u2019t take care of his mom. I hope one day you can see in me the man that you once hoped that I would be.\u201d Throughout the movie\u2019s near-two-hour running time, we see the actor that Hollywood hoped Affleck could be. It\u2019s promise fulfilled\u2014and reason to believe that the next 30 years of Affleck\u2019s career could surpass the last 30. Writing and starring in the underdog drama with Matt Damon was the official, noisy, Oscar-winning arrival for the longtime BFFs. The dramatic heft of Good Will Hunting rests on Damon and Robin Williams, but Affleck\u2019s Chuckie is responsible for two of the film\u2019s defining moments. He first showcases his comedic talents while posing as his genius best friend, Will, in a job interview and forever changing how we hear the word \u201cretainer.\u201d Of course, that pales in comparison to the legacy of Chuckie\u2019s \u201cthe best part of my day\u201d monologue, in which the blue-collar character reveals previously unseen layers. Damon appeared to get the bigger immediate bump from Good Will Hunting , scoring a Best Actor nomination and, for some strange reason, more of the creative credit, which now looks foolish following Affleck\u2019s rebirth as an elite filmmaker. And while the duo\u2019s careers went in very different directions afterward, there was no debating that two new A-listers had arrived in Hollywood. Just a year after his overall career peaked with Argo \u2019s Best Picture victory, Affleck reaches what is likely, so far, his movie-star peak. Think about it: He\u2019s the face of a critically acclaimed adult drama from one of Hollywood\u2019s great auteurs that makes almost $400 million. Rosamund Pike deserved the moment she had upon Gone Girl \u2019s release, but Affleck\u2019s performance has better stood the test of time. Affleck was so well cast as Nick Dunne that he was believable as both the cheating husband who probably killed his wife and the idiot husband who might have been framed for his wife\u2019s murder. And director David Fincher picked Affleck for a very specific reason , playing with his persona and celebrity in a way that I\u2019m not entirely sure Affleck was in on. Whether those elements were conscious in Affleck\u2019s approach or not, he should have joined Pike as an Oscar nominee. (Steve Carell in Foxcatcher ? Really?)

Murphy, author of Dirty Chick: Adventures of an Unlikely Farmer published by Penguin Random House, moved from the U.S. to New Zealand, where sex work is decriminalized, and in 2016 founded an escort agency built on a philosophy of protecting women\u2019s legal rights, emotional well-being, and financial independence. A half-hour dramedy adaptation is underway with Shoshana McCallum, who won an International Emmy for NZ series Inside, and Harry McNaughton ( The Pact ) writing. It is Tavake and XYZ \u2019s first series collaboration. Related Story Supernatural Thriller 'The Island Between Tides', Based On Storied J.M. Barrie Play, Sets Cast, XYZ Films, First Look As Shoot Kicks Off Tom Hern ( Shadow in the Cloud , The Dark Horse ), Halaifonua Finau ( The Panthers ) and Crystal Vaega ( The Panthers ) are executive-producing for Tavake, with Nick Spicer and Marci Wiseman for XYZ . Eric and Susan Carlson are also executive producers. Murphy is a consulting producer on the project. Feature firm XYZ, which specializes in genre fare, has recently added a slate of TV projects including documentary series and adaptations of its own feature IP, often working alongside former Blumhouse TV Co-President Marci Wiseman. \u201cA human rights-based escort agency is a radical concept, and for years people were shocked and scared by what we were doing,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cBut the culture has changed in the past few years. People want honesty. I\u2019m so thrilled to finally be able to tell our story.\u201d \u201cAs producers, we\u2019re always on the hunt for exceptional human beings with unique stories to tell. Antonia is most certainly one of those people,\u201d Hern commented. \u201cWe\u2019re excited by the prospect of taking audiences into the thick of the legal sex work industry with humor, humanity and lots of heart,\u201d added Vaega. \u201c Madame Mom promises to be a wry, dark comedy looking at motherhood, feminism, and the controversial topic of legal prostitution through an entirely unique lens. Combining the edge of shows like Weeds and Shameless , and the indie spirit of Red Rocket, we couldn\u2019t resist bringing this project to life,\u201d said Wiseman and Spicer. Murphy is represented by Alice Tasman at Jean V. Naggar Literary Agency and UTA.",

Sebastian Kaulitzki/Science Photo LibraryMore than 5 million people in the United States are affected by limb loss or paralysis. Technological devices that directly interact with the brain, known as brain-computer interfaces, offer the potential to decode an individual\u2019s thoughts and translate them into action using a robotic arm or a cursor on a screen. These neuroprosthetics can take the place of an amputated or paralyzed arm, for instance, helping the user take an action. Much research in this field to date has focused on decoding brain signals \u2013 what is it that the person wants to do? But there\u2019s another equally important part of any real-world prosthetic system. It needs to be able to convey information in the other direction, too, back to the brain to provide feedback from the external world. Think about how challenging it would be to interact with the world in the absence of touch. Tasks such as lighting a match, picking up an egg and grasping a coffee cup become tremendously difficult. At the University of Washington\u2019s Center for Neurotechnology, our team is working out how best to engineer stimulation to the brain to restore tactile sensations that allow people to perform useful tasks. To this end, we are studying how people respond to sensation triggered by electrical stimulation of the brain. Our goal is to help devise a system that someday will allow someone who has lost the sense of touch to feel a loved one\u2019s hand again. Speed of natural touch versus brain stimulation Collaborating with neurosurgeons Jeffrey Ojemann and Andrew Ko, we rely on patient volunteers who generously allow us to carry out research while they are undergoing treatment for epilepsy. Many brain surgeries are performed with the patient awake and able to provide live feedback. BSIP/Universal Images Group via Getty Images To help localize the origin of a patient\u2019s seizures prior to removing brain tissue to potentially help their epilepsy, Ojemann and Ko temporarily implant small, metal electrodes on top of and within the patient\u2019s brain. These electrodes monitor the brain\u2019s epileptic seizures so the neurosurgeons know where \u2013 and where not \u2013 to operate. Our experiments use those same electrodes in two ways. We can record the electrical activity of the brain\u2019s neurons. And we are also able to inject small amounts of electric current into specific parts of the brain. When we send a small burst of electricity to the touch-processing areas of the brain, the person experiences tactile sensations. In other words, when we activate particular neurons with electricity, the volunteer experiences it as if we were touching a particular part of their body. In one study, we wanted to understand which tactile sensation an individual would perceive faster \u2013 artificial stimulation due to direct electrical stimulation of the brain via electrode, or natural tactile sensation due to a real touch on the patient\u2019s hand? We asked our subjects to press a button as quickly as possible using the hand opposite to where they felt the sensation. They were blindfolded to eliminate the potential for visual feedback that might confound our results. Response times to direct stimulation of neurons in the brain were slower than response times to natural touch. Caldwell and Rao, CC BY-ND What we discovered was surprising. Individuals responded more slowly to direct stimulation of their brain\u2019s primary somatosensory cortex compared to a natural touch to their fingers. Even though an electric signal directly from the electrode in the brain bypassed all the peripheral nerves between the hand and head, the signal that traveled the longer journey up the ascending sensory nerves registered first. This result held up even when we tested subjects again after a short break, suggesting that it cannot be explained solely as a novel sensation that the subjects needed time to learn. [The Conversation\u2019s science, health and technology editors pick their favorite stories. Weekly on Wednesdays.] Previous studies in nonhuman primates have found similar delays in reaction time relative to natural touch when researchers delivered electrical stimulation to a single location within somatosensory cortex. On the other hand, more recent research using multiple electrodes to stimulate somatosensory cortex in nonhuman primates found that such electrical stimulation could elicit response times slightly faster than natural touch. Together, these studies demonstrate the complexities of stimulating the brain to replace natural tactile feedback. Future technologies and engineering strategies will need to take into account variability in touch sensation depending on how electrical stimulation is targeted in the brain. Engineering around a sensory lag By discovering a delay in how people respond to direct electrical stimulation of their brains, we have revealed potential limitations in how current engineered solutions perform. The delay might limit how well future sensory neuroprosthetic devices using these clinical electrodes can work. Fine motor movements \u2013 like picking up an egg without crushing it \u2013 rely on calibrating the effort based on what your sense of touch tells you. Jackyenjoyphotography/Moment via Getty Images Designers may need to account for a significant lag in artificial sensation relative to natural touch. For instance, if a user doesn\u2019t receive feedback from touch sensors on a robotic hand quickly enough, and the overall system does not account for this delay in perception, someone attempting to pick up an egg with a robotic hand could apply too much pressure and crush it. To improve reaction times and more broadly to enhance the utility of direct brain stimulation, we will need to take into account ongoing brain activity and tailor the electrical stimulation patterns for each person\u2019s brain and the task at hand. To achieve this goal, we have recently proposed a new type of brain-computer interface called a brain co-processor, which uses artificial intelligence to compute the best stimulation patterns for a task given current brain activity. Such an approach allows multiple electrodes to be used, possibly targeting multiple regions, and relies on co-adaptation with the brain to better approximate natural sensations. Can electrical stimulation meaningfully substitute for natural touch during a complex task in the real world? We believe so. It will require both understanding the intricacies of information processing in the brain and incorporating this knowledge into future brain co-processors and neuroprosthetic devices for restoring touch.

            "description": "After 355 days aboard the ISS, NASA astronaut and five-time flight engineer Mark T Vande Hei returns to Earth as record holder for the longest single spaceflight in NASA history, having surpassed Commander Scott Kelly\u2019s 340-day mark set in 2018. Though not as long as Peggy Whitson\u2019s 665 cumulative days spent in microgravity, Vande Hei\u2019s accomplishment is still one of the longest single stints in human spaceflight, just behind Russia\u2019s Valeri Polyakov, who was aboard the Mir for 438 straight days (that\u2019s more than 14 months) back in the mid-1990s.Though NASA\u2019s Human Research Program has spent 50 years studying the effects that microgravity and the rigors of spaceflight have on the human body, the full impact of long-duration space travel has yet to be exhaustively researched. As humanity\u2019s expansion into space accelerates in the coming decades, more people will be going into orbit \u2014 and much farther \u2014 both more regularly and for longer than anyone has in the past half century, and they\u2019ll invariably need medical care while they\u2019re out there. To fill that need, academic institutes like the Center for Space Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, TX, have begun training a new generation of medical practitioners with the skills necessary to keep tomorrow\u2019s commercial astronauts alive on the job.Even traveling the relatively short 62 mile distance to the International Space Station does a number on the human body. The sustained force generated during liftoff can hit 3 gs, though \u201cthe most important factors in determining the effects the sustained acceleration will have on the human body is the rate of onset and the peak sustained g force,\u201d Dr. Eric Jackson wrote in his 2017 dissertation, An Investigation of the Effects of Sustained G-Forces on the Human Body During Suborbital Spaceflight. \u201cThe rate of onset, or how fast the body accelerates, dictates the ability to remain conscious, with a faster rate of onset leading to a lower g-force threshold.\u201dUntrained civilians will begin feeling these effects at 3 to 4 gs but with practice, seasoned astronauts using support equipment like high-g suits can resist the effects until around 8 or 9 gs, however the unprotected human body can only withstand about 5 gs of persistent force before blacking out.Once the primary and secondary rocket stages have been expended, the pleasantness of the spaceflight will improve immensely, albeit temporarily. As NASA veteran with 230 cumulative days in space, Leroy Chiao, told Space in 2016, as soon as the main engines cut out, the crushing Gs subside and \u201cyou are instantly weightless. It feels as if you suddenly did a forward roll on a gym mat, as your brain struggles to understand the odd signals coming from your balance system.\u201d\u201cDizziness is the result, and this can again cause some nausea,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou also feel immediate pressure in your head, as if you were lying down head first on an incline. At this point, because gravity is no longer pulling fluid into your lower extremities, it rises into your torso. Over the next few days, your body will eliminate about two liters of water to compensate, and your brain learns to ignore your balance system. Your body equilibrates with the environment over the next several weeks.\u201dRoughly half of people who have traveled into orbit to date have experienced this phenomenon, which has been dubbed Space Adaptation Syndrome (SAS), though as Chiao noted, the status debuffs do lessen as the astronaut\u2019s vestibular system readjusts to their weightless environment. And even as the astronaut adapts to function in their new microgravity surroundings, their body is undergoing fundamental changes that will not abate, at least until they head back down the gravity well.\u201cAfter a long-duration flight of six or more months, the symptoms are somewhat more intense,\u201d Chiao said. \u201cIf you've been on a short flight, you feel better after a day or two. But after a long flight, it usually takes a week, or several, before you feel like you're back to normal.\u201d\u201cSpaceflight is draining because you've taken away a lot of the physical stimulus the body would have on an everyday basis,\u201d Dr. Jennifer Fogarty from Baylor\u2019s Center for Space Medicine, told Engadget.\u201cCells can convert mechanical inputs into biochemical signals, initiating downstream signaling cascades in a process known as mechanotransduction,\u201d researchers from the University of Siena noted in their 2021 study, The Effect of Space Travel on Bone Metabolism. \u201cTherefore, any changes in mechanical loading, for example, those associated with microgravity, can consequently influence cell functionality and tissue homeostasis, leading to altered physiological conditions.\u201dWithout those sensory inputs and environmental stressors that would normally prompt the body to maintain its current level of fitness, our muscles will atrophy \u2014 up to 40 percent of their mass, depending on the length for the mission \u2014 while our bones can lose their mineral density at a rate of 1 to 2 percent every month.\"Your bones are ... being continually eaten away and replenished,\" pioneering Canadian astronaut Bjarni Tryggvason told CBC in 2013. \"The replenishment depends on the actual stresses in your bones and it's mainly ... bones in your legs where the stresses are all of a sudden reduced [in space] that you see the major bone loss.\u201dThis leaves astronauts highly susceptible to breaks, as well as kidney stones, upon their return to Earth and generally require two months of recovery for every month spent in microgravity. In fact, a 2000 study found that the bone loss from six months in space \u201cparallels that experienced by elderly men and women over a decade of aging on Earth.\u201d Even intensive daily sessions with the treadmill, cycle ergometer and ARED (Advanced Resistance Exercise Device) aboard the ISS, paired with a balanced nutrient-rich diet, has only shown to be partially effective at offsetting the incurred mineral losses.And then there\u2019s the space anemia. According to a study published in the journal, Nature Medicine, the bodies of astronauts appear to destroy their red blood cells faster while in space than they would here on Earth. \"Space anemia has consistently been reported when astronauts returned to Earth since the first space missions, but we didn't know why,\" study author Guy Trudel said in a January 14 statement. \u201cOur study shows that upon arriving in space, more red blood cells are destroyed, and this continues for the entire duration of the astronaut\u2019s mission.\u201dThis is not a short term adaptation as previously believed, the study found. The human body on Earth will produce and destroy around 2 million red blood cells every second. However, that number jumps to roughly 3 million per second while in space, a 54 percent increase that researchers attribute to fluid shifts in the body as it adapts to weightlessness.Recent research also suggests that our brains are actively \u201crewiring\u201d themselves in order to adapt to microgravity. A study published in Frontiers in Neural Circuits investigated structural changes found in white matter, which interfaces the brain\u2019s two hemispheres, after space travel using MRI data collected from a dozen Cosmonauts before and after their stays aboard the ISS, for about 172 days apiece. Researchers discovered changes in the neural connections between different motor areas within the brain as well as changes to the shape of the corpus callosum, the part of the brain that connects and interfaces the two hemispheres, again due to fluid shifts.\"These findings give us additional pieces of the entire puzzle,\" study author Floris Wuyts of Floris Wuyts, University of Antwerp told Space. \"Since this research is so pioneering, we don't know how the whole puzzle will look yet. These results contribute to our overall understanding of what's going on in the brains of space travelers.\"As the transition towards commercial space flight accelerates and the orbital economy further opens for business, opportunities to advance space medicine increase as well. Fogarty points out that government space flight programs and installations are severely limited in the number of astronauts they can handle simultaneously \u2014 the ISS holds a whopping seven people at a time \u2014 which translates into multi-year long queues for astronauts waiting to go into space. Commercial ventures like Orbital Reef will shorten those waits by expanding the number of space-based positions available which will give institutions like the Center for Space Medicine more, and more diversified, health data to analyze.\u201cThe diversity of the types of people that are capable and willing to go [into space for work] really opens up this aperture on understanding humanity,\u201d Fogarty said, \u201cversus the [existing] select population that we always struggle to match to or interpret data from.\u201dEven returning from space is fraught with physiological peril. Dr. Fogarty points out that while in space the gyroscopic organs in the inner ear will adapt to the new environment, which is what helps alleviate the symptoms of SAS. However, that adaptation works against the astronaut when they return to full gravity \u2014 especially the chaotic forces present during reentry \u2014 they can be shocked by the sudden return of amplified sensory information. It\u2019s roughly equivalent, she describes, to continuing to turn up the volume on a stereo with a wonky input port: You hear nothing as you rotate the knob, right up until the moment the input\u2019s plug wiggles just enough to connect and you blow your eardrums out because you\u2019d dialed up the volume to 11 without realizing it.\u201cYour brain has acclimated to an environment, and very quickly,\u201d Fogarty said. \u201cBut the organ systems in your ear haven't caught up to the new environment.\u201d These effects, like SAS, are temporary and do not appear to limit the amount of times an astronaut can venture up to orbit and return. \u201cThere's really no evidence to say that we would know there would be a limit,\u201d she said, envisioning it could end up being more of a personal choice in deciding if the after-effects and recovery times are worth it for your next trip to space.",

But after a long flight, it usually takes a week, or several, before you feel like you're back to normal.\u201d \u201cSpaceflight is draining because you've taken away a lot of the physical stimulus the body would have on an everyday basis,\u201d Dr. Jennifer Fogarty from Baylor\u2019s Center for Space Medicine, told Engadget. \u201cCells can convert mechanical inputs into biochemical signals, initiating downstream signaling cascades in a process known as mechanotransduction ,\u201d researchers from the University of Siena noted in their 2021 study, The Effect of Space Travel on Bone Metabolism . \u201cTherefore, any changes in mechanical loading, for example, those associated with microgravity, can consequently influence cell functionality and tissue homeostasis, leading to altered physiological conditions.\u201d Without those sensory inputs and environmental stressors that would normally prompt the body to maintain its current level of fitness, our muscles will atrophy \u2014 up to 40 percent of their mass, depending on the length for the mission \u2014 while our bones can lose their mineral density at a rate of 1 to 2 percent every month . \"Your bones are ... being continually eaten away and replenished,\" pioneering Canadian astronaut Bjarni Tryggvason told CBC in 2013. \"The replenishment depends on the actual stresses in your bones and it's mainly ... bones in your legs where the stresses are all of a sudden reduced [in space] that you see the major bone loss.\u201d This leaves astronauts highly susceptible to breaks, as well as kidney stones, upon their return to Earth and generally require two months of recovery for every month spent in microgravity. In fact, a 2000 study found that the bone loss from six months in space \u201cparallels that experienced by elderly men and women over a decade of aging on Earth.\u201d Even intensive daily sessions with the treadmill, cycle ergometer and ARED (Advanced Resistance Exercise Device) aboard the ISS, paired with a balanced nutrient-rich diet, has only shown to be partially effective at offsetting the incurred mineral losses. And then there\u2019s the space anemia. According to a study published in the journal, Nature Medicine , the bodies of astronauts appear to destroy their red blood cells faster while in space than they would here on Earth. \"Space anemia has consistently been reported when astronauts returned to Earth since the first space missions, but we didn't know why,\" study author Guy Trudel said in a January 14 statement . \u201cOur study shows that upon arriving in space, more red blood cells are destroyed, and this continues for the entire duration of the astronaut\u2019s mission.\u201d This is not a short term adaptation as previously believed, the study found. The human body on Earth will produce and destroy around 2 million red blood cells every second. However, that number jumps to roughly 3 million per second while in space , a 54 percent increase that researchers attribute to fluid shifts in the body as it adapts to weightlessness. Recent research also suggests that our brains are actively \u201crewiring\u201d themselves in order to adapt to microgravity. A study published in Frontiers in Neural Circuits investigated structural changes found in white matter , which interfaces the brain\u2019s two hemispheres, after space travel using MRI data collected from a dozen Cosmonauts before and after their stays aboard the ISS, for about 172 days apiece. Researchers discovered changes in the neural connections between different motor areas within the brain as well as changes to the shape of the corpus callosum, the part of the brain that connects and interfaces the two hemispheres, again due to fluid shifts. \"These findings give us additional pieces of the entire puzzle,\" study author Floris Wuyts of Floris Wuyts, University of Antwerp told Space . \"Since this research is so pioneering, we don't know how the whole puzzle will look yet. These results contribute to our overall understanding of what's going on in the brains of space travelers.\" As the transition towards commercial space flight accelerates and the orbital economy further opens for business, opportunities to advance space medicine increase as well. Fogarty points out that government space flight programs and installations are severely limited in the number of astronauts they can handle simultaneously \u2014 the ISS holds a whopping seven people at a time \u2014 which translates into multi-year long queues for astronauts waiting to go into space. Commercial ventures like Orbital Reef will shorten those waits by expanding the number of space-based positions available which will give institutions like the Center for Space Medicine more, and more diversified, health data to analyze. \u201cThe diversity of the types of people that are capable and willing to go [into space for work] really opens up this aperture on understanding humanity,\u201d Fogarty said, \u201cversus the [existing] select population that we always struggle to match to or interpret data from.\u201d Even returning from space is fraught with physiological peril. Dr. Fogarty points out that while in space the gyroscopic organs in the inner ear will adapt to the new environment, which is what helps alleviate the symptoms of SAS. However, that adaptation works against the astronaut when they return to full gravity \u2014 especially the chaotic forces present during reentry \u2014 they can be shocked by the sudden return of amplified sensory information. It\u2019s roughly equivalent, she describes, to continuing to turn up the volume on a stereo with a wonky input port: You hear nothing as you rotate the knob, right up until the moment the input\u2019s plug wiggles just enough to connect and you blow your eardrums out because you\u2019d dialed up the volume to 11 without realizing it. \u201cYour brain has acclimated to an environment, and very quickly,\u201d Fogarty said. \u201cBut the organ systems in your ear haven't caught up to the new environment.\u201d These effects, like SAS, are temporary and do not appear to limit the amount of times an astronaut can venture up to orbit and return. \u201cThere's really no evidence to say that we would know there would be a limit,\u201d she said, envisioning it could end up being more of a personal choice in deciding if the after-effects and recovery times are worth it for your next trip to space.",

At around 42 million years old, it\u2019s thought to be one of the first sabre-tooth cat-like predators to have roamed the planet \u2013 and a formidable hunter capable of killing prey much larger than itself. None of our existing top predators possess a sabre-tooth. But throughout much of the history of wild cats, there have been sabre-toothed forms. Indeed, from 2.5 million years ago, until as recently as 10,000 years ago, the iconic Smilodon fatalis \u2013 commonly known as the sabre-tooth tiger \u2013 was on the prowl in California and other parts of North and South America. Although its main focus were the large, thick-skinned mammoths and woolly rhinos, early humans might well have been at risk, too. Though this newly described animal was smaller than Smilodon, the sabre-tooth adaptation means it was probably one of the first ever mammalian hypercarnivores, surviving almost exclusively on a diet of meat \u2013 a lifestyle followed by modern cats today. The sabre-tooth discovery In the new PeerJ study scientists from the University of Arizona and San Diego Natural History Museum describe the new predator, which they named Diegoaelurus vanvalkenburghae after San Diego county, in southern California, where the fossil was found, and Professor Van Valkenburgh, the doyenne of carnivore evolution. The beautiful piece of lower jaw had sat unappreciated in the drawers of the San Diego museum since 1988 \u2013 until Curator Ashley Poust found it and recognised what it was. And although it doesn\u2019t sound like much to go on, we can actually learn a huge amount about this ancient creature from the fossilised jaw and teeth alone. When compared with a skull cast of a Smilodon, the Diegoaelurus fossil is much smaller with a more pronounced chin bone (lower-right edge). CC by 4.0. Cypress Hansen, San Diego Natural History Museum, CC BY At the back of the newly discovered jaw there are slicing scissor teeth, called carnassials \u2013 the equivalent of molars and premolars \u2013 shaped like flesh-cutting blades with multiple points. Going forward in the jaw, there is a long gap, and then the key tooth, the canine sabre-tooth, elongated and curved. Below that, is an expanded and deepened portion at the front of the jawbone that partly accommodates the deeply rooted canine tooth, and also provides added strength for the jawbone when it bites with force. The unpreserved upper jawbone would have featured an equivalent canine sabre tooth, which would have cut down outside the jaw as the animal seized its prey. We can learn so much about the size and diet of Diegoaelurus from this 42-million-year-old jawbone fossil. CC BY 4.0. Cypress Hansen, San Diego Natural History Museum, CC BY The fossil also allowed the study authors to identify that Diegoaelurus is a machaeroidine, a sub-family of extinct mammals from North America and Asia. But our new knowledge doesn\u2019t end there. From long-term studies of the rocks and fossils of California, scientists can form a picture of the newly discovered animal\u2019s habitat and lifestyle. California in the middle Eocene \u2013 the time 42 million years ago when Diegoaelurus lived \u2013 was a land of rich tropical forests through which the bobcat-sized Diegoaelurus slipped silently in search of prey. The forests teemed with rodents and early primates in the trees, as well as larger herbivorous mammals, such as even-toed oreodonts (most closely related to camels and pigs), early hoofed tapiroids, multi-toed horses, and the small rhinocerous Menoceras, on the ground. Perhaps this first sabre-tooth concentrated on hunting these thick-skinned ungulates, leaping from the trees onto their backs and biting suddenly and deeply. Could the sabre-tooth return? Although Diegoaelurus looked similar to cats, they are, in fact, unrelated. But the sabre-toothed adaptation to hypercarnivory arose independently several times among cats in other extinct sub-families, such as the nimravids, the \u201csabre-tooth false cats\u201d in North America and Eurasia \u2013 and even in the marsupial thylacosmilids of South America. Read more: When two ecosystems collided, ichthyosaurs re-evolved the ability to consume large prey But when Smilodon \u2013 the last known survivor of the most recent sub-family, Machairodontinae \u2013 became extinct, probably due to loss of prey or hunting by early humans, the sabre-tooth disappeared. Tigers are fearsome predators but struggle to bring down prey much bigger than themselves. Photo by Pixabay, CC BY-NC-SA Most cats today operate as solitary hunters, and so generally tackle prey that is of a similar size to themselves, or smaller, in contrast to the sabre-tooths who were able to take on much larger prey. The modern family Felidae \u2013 which includes all modern cats \u2013 has 41 species, including the pantherines, such as lions, tigers and leopards, and the felines, such as cheetahs, pumas and caracal. Some of the larger cats \u2013 tigers and lions, for example \u2013 are hypercarnivores who live only on the flesh of other large animals. Smaller cats are carnivores, of course, but with broader diets which can include rodents, birds, lizards and even invertebrates such as bugs and beetles. It could be suggested that sabre teeth are an adaptation that is urgently required by many modern large cats. Lions and tigers do have large canine teeth that are used to pierce and kill \u2013 but they could certainly benefit from canines that are longer and stronger. When a lion tries to bring down a Cape buffalo or a juvenile elephant, it struggles to make a killing bite. Even Chilean pumas struggle to bite through the hide of a guanaco (a native of South America and close relative of the llama) and only succeed in killing their prey in one hunt out of ten. And with their thicker skin, pachyderms like buffalo, hippos, rhinos and elephants are more or less immune from attack. Indeed, sabre-teeth could save the lives of many modern large hunting cats by making the hunt safer. So will one of the modern cat species evolve them? Well, it seems like leopards might already be moving in that direction, so only time will tell. Michael J.

Nevertheless it remains constantly active with new DLC and promotions and now, roughly eight years after its initial release, has hit the considerable milestone of 50 million players. The developer announced the news with a short gif that bounces off the double Spider-Man meme. Thank you to all our players, we hope to see you in the fog! pic.twitter.com/akGICNf1VB March 29, 2022 Dead by Daylight is great fun and surprisingly inventive , one of those games all-encompassing enough to become some folks' main poison. There's no shortage of paid DLC expanding its roster either, though the game sensibly allows all players to play alongside any DLC characters and maps, regardless of what they own. The news of 50 million players came alongside the launch of a Kickstarter for a boardgame version of DBD : after only a few days it has already, unsurprisingly, sailed past its initial target of \u00a3190,000 and currently sits on just over \u00a3263,000. The boardgame is being created by Level 99 Games, a company that's delivered dozens of past kickstarter projects, and is a 3-5 player asymmetrical experience patterned after DBD's core mechanics. So you have a bunch of survivors, who have challenges like turning generators back on, while a killer prowls around and tries to... well, kill them. The below video gives a primer on the boardgame. The boardgame also comes with a tie-in promotion for some currency in the videogame: enter the code DBDTHEBOARDGAME through the in-game store for 200,000 Bloodpoints. It's funny how, since Left4Dead, there have been so many high-profile attempts at making asymmetrical monster-vs-human games the next big hit: it seems like only yesterday Back4Blood was the latest contender. Dead by Daylight wasn't a smash hit out of the gate but has quietly grown and grown over the years, and now looms large over the competition.",

It is one of Stephen King 's most epic works and is set in the fictional town of Derry in Maine, as are a number of King's other novels. The novel follows seven children who find themselves terrorized by an evil entity that exploits the fears of its victims to disguise itself while hunting its prey.

The novel, which is a whopping 1,138 pages, has been adapted twice.

The HBO Max series looks set to lead up to the events of the first novel and will no doubt shed some light on the origins of Pennywise. Andy Muschietti, director of both Warner Brothers' recent movies, It: Part One and It: Part Two, is to be an executive producer on the project, while Jason Fuchs, whose credits include Wonder Woman and Apple TV+'s new blockbuster Argylle, is to write the series.

            "content": "Compared to other Marvel characters like Spider-Man or Captain America, there haven\u2019t been a lot of Moon Knight comics published. However, there\u2019s still been enough to make knowing what you should pick up feel a bit daunting. After all, there are nine first issues of Moon Knight. If you\u2019ve been keen on the live-action adaptation of Moon Knight and are interested in reading one of the many comic series it\u2019s drawn inspiration from, we\u2019ve got the perfect place for you to start. Written by Jeff Lemire and mostly drawn by Greg Smallwood, if you\u2019re going to pick up one Moon Knight comic after watching the TV show, make it this one. Who is Moon Knight? Image: Moon Knight #11 cover, Greg Smallwood /Marvel Comics Moon Knight is Marc Spector, a former Marine and mercenary for hire who died, only to be resurrected by the Egyptian moon god, Khonshu. Back from the dead, Spector becomes the moon\u2019s knight, taking on the white-caped mantle while fighting crime and dishing out vengeance as the \u201cFist of Khonshu\u201d. But here\u2019s where Moon Knight gets interesting. Moon Knight is also Steven Grant, a Wallstreet billionaire, and Jake Lockley, a streetwise New York City taxi driver. He\u2019s all of the above because Spector suffers from a dissociative identity disorder. Or maybe he\u2019s none of these people and his entire life has been a lie. What is this Moon Knight comic about? Image: Greg Smallwood/Marvel Comics window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_1_mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); What if you woke up one morning and discovered your entire life wasn\u2019t real? That\u2019s where Lemire and Smallwood\u2019s Moon Knight comic starts, with Marc Spector awakening in a mental institute and learning that his entire life up to the point was just an extended hallucination. Moon Knight is a real hero, but Spector isn\u2019t him. But when Khonshu appears before Spector and tells him that this is all the scheme of Ammit, another Egyptian god who is looking to invade earth, he doesn\u2019t know what to believe. Are Khonshu and his life as Moon Knight real or has it all just been a figment of Spector\u2019s fractured imagination? Why do you need to read it? Image: Greg Smallwood/Marvel Comics This Moon Knight series is the perfect introduction to the character because it takes a deep dive into who exactly Moon Knight is, both literally and figuratively. It combines the psychological with the supernatural, as Marc Spector attempts to piece together the fractured pieces of his many lives. Are all of these different personalities separate beings, or do they amount to a whole? Lemire does a great job of planting seeds of doubt while you\u2019re reading it by purposefully dissolving the line between what is and isn\u2019t real. His friends and sidekicks? They\u2019re just other patients at the institute. It\u2019s an interesting character study and a somewhat idiosyncratic superhero story, where the bulk of the action takes place in a single person\u2019s mind, and may or may not actually be real. Image: Greg Smallwood/Marvel Comics More than anything, this book looks incredible. Smallwood is one of the best comic artists working at the moment, and the combination of Jordie Bellaire\u2019s amazing colours make his work sing. window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_1_hpu-mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); Smallwood\u2019s panel layouts don\u2019t follow the rigid columns and rows of traditional comics. Instead, they overlap, are asymmetrical and use a lot of negative space. One page has the panels laid out in the shape of an exclamation mark, which led the reader\u2019s eyes to a panel of Spector being given electroshock therapy in the exclamation dot. Combined with Lemire\u2019s writing, it captures the disjointed state of Spector\u2019s mind. As the series progresses and Spector\u2019s grip on reality begins to loosen, more artists are added to the fold to give each of his personalities a different aesthetic. When he\u2019s in the Jake Lockley persona, Francesco Francavilla draws a moody, 1970s-inspired New York, while Wilfredo Torres\u2019 clean and simple lines capture the \u201creal-life\u201d normalcy of Steven Grant. The real treat of this rotating art team is James Stokoe\u2019s bombastic sci-fi action for an alternate Marc Spector persona, who is now Moon Knight One, an ace spaceship pilot tasked with protecting the moon from an army of werewolves. Image: The art of Wilfredo Torres, James Stokoe and Francesco Francavilla collide/Marvel Comics This combination of art styles is a fantastic example of how good comics can be as a visual medium. It gives the reader a vivid shorthand of how fractured Spector\u2019s mind is \u2013 especially when the different art styles begin to clash on the same page. Lemire embraces the entire history of the character and attempts to form it into a single, cohesive narrative. If you\u2019ve never read a Moon Knight comic before, the final arc of this series also retells Spector\u2019s origin story, from the first time his identity disorder manifests to his resurrection by Khonshu. window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_2_mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); The series is also a fairly short one, clocking in at just 14 issues, and was recently re-released as a complete collection. If you want to read one of, if not the best Moon Knight stories ever published, or just want a great superhero book, this comic won\u2019t disappoint. You can buy Moon Knight by Lemire and Smallwood: The Complete Collection here: Amazon Australia ($50.62) | Book Depository ($59.82) | Booktopia ($57.50) Are there any other Moon Knight comics you should read? Image: Moon Knight #1 (2006) cover, David Finch/Marvel Comics The 2006 Moon Knight series written by Charlie Huston and drawn by David Finch, takes a more gritty, street-level approach to the character. With Finch\u2019s grim art, Huston writes a considerably more brooding and violent version of the character than in previous stories and focuses on Moon Knight losing his connection to Khonshu along with his grip on his sanity. If you ever wanted to read a Marvel comic where a hero peels off a guy\u2019s face, this is the book for you. The most recent Moon Knight series by Jed Mackay and Alessandro Cappuccio has also been a real blast. This version of the character has opened the \u201cMidnight Mission\u201d, a temple dedicated to the teachings of Khonshu, while also embracing his role as \u201cthe defender of those who travel at night\u201d. Mr. Knight takes it upon himself to protect anyone who requests his help, which involves him facing off against vampires and Hunter\u2019s Moon, the second fist of Khonshu. And, no, those comic panels where Moon Knight calls Dracula a \u201cbig fucking nerd\u201d aren\u2019t real. The truth hurts, I know. Moon Knight will be streaming on Disney+ from 30 March.

BTW - prices are accurate and items in stock at the time of posting. Compared to other Marvel characters like Spider-Man or Captain America, there haven\u2019t been a lot of Moon Knight comics published. However, there\u2019s still been enough to make knowing what you should pick up feel a bit daunting. After all, there are nine first issues of Moon Knight . If you\u2019ve been keen on the live-action adaptation of Moon Knight and are interested in reading one of the many comic series it\u2019s drawn inspiration from, we\u2019ve got the perfect place for you to start. Written by Jeff Lemire and mostly drawn by Greg Smallwood, if you\u2019re going to pick up one Moon Knight comic after watching the TV show, make it this one. Table of Contents Who is Moon Knight? What is this Moon Knight comic about? Why do you need to read it? Are there any other Moon Knight comics you should read? Who is Moon Knight? Image: Moon Knight #11 cover, Greg Smallwood /Marvel Comics Moon Knight is Marc Spector, a former Marine and mercenary for hire who died, only to be resurrected by the Egyptian moon god, Khonshu. Back from the dead, Spector becomes the moon\u2019s knight, taking on the white-caped mantle while fighting crime and dishing out vengeance as the \u201cFist of Khonshu\u201d. But here\u2019s where Moon Knight gets interesting. Moon Knight is also Steven Grant, a Wallstreet billionaire, and Jake Lockley, a streetwise New York City taxi driver. He\u2019s all of the above because Spector suffers from a dissociative identity disorder. Or maybe he\u2019s none of these people and his entire life has been a lie. What is this Moon Knight comic about? Image: Greg Smallwood/Marvel Comics What if you woke up one morning and discovered your entire life wasn\u2019t real? That\u2019s where Lemire and Smallwood\u2019s Moon Knight comic starts, with Marc Spector awakening in a mental institute and learning that his entire life up to the point was just an extended hallucination . Moon Knight is a real hero, but Spector isn\u2019t him. But when Khonshu appears before Spector and tells him that this is all the scheme of Ammit, another Egyptian god who is looking to invade earth, he doesn\u2019t know what to believe. Are Khonshu and his life as Moon Knight real or has it all just been a figment of Spector\u2019s fractured imagination? Why do you need to read it? Image: Greg Smallwood/Marvel Comics This Moon Knight series is the perfect introduction to the character because it takes a deep dive into who exactly Moon Knight is, both literally and figuratively. It combines the psychological with the supernatural, as Marc Spector attempts to piece together the fractured pieces of his many lives. Are all of these different personalities separate beings, or do they amount to a whole? Lemire does a great job of planting seeds of doubt while you\u2019re reading it by purposefully dissolving the line between what is and isn\u2019t real. His friends and sidekicks? They\u2019re just other patients at the institute. It\u2019s an interesting character study and a somewhat idiosyncratic superhero story, where the bulk of the action takes place in a single person\u2019s mind, and may or may not actually be real. Image: Greg Smallwood/Marvel Comics More than anything, this book looks incredible. Smallwood is one of the best comic artists working at the moment, and the combination of Jordie Bellaire\u2019s amazing colours make his work sing. Smallwood\u2019s panel layouts don\u2019t follow the rigid columns and rows of traditional comics. Instead, they overlap, are asymmetrical and use a lot of negative space. One page has the panels laid out in the shape of an exclamation mark, which led the reader\u2019s eyes to a panel of Spector being given electroshock therapy in the exclamation dot. Combined with Lemire\u2019s writing, it captures the disjointed state of Spector\u2019s mind. As the series progresses and Spector\u2019s grip on reality begins to loosen, more artists are added to the fold to give each of his personalities a different aesthetic. When he\u2019s in the Jake Lockley persona, Francesco Francavilla draws a moody, 1970s-inspired New York, while Wilfredo Torres\u2019 clean and simple lines capture the \u201creal-life\u201d normalcy of Steven Grant. The real treat of this rotating art team is James Stokoe\u2019s bombastic sci-fi action for an alternate Marc Spector persona, who is now Moon Knight One, an ace spaceship pilot tasked with protecting the moon from an army of werewolves. Image: The art of Wilfredo Torres, James Stokoe and Francesco Francavilla collide/Marvel Comics This combination of art styles is a fantastic example of how good comics can be as a visual medium. It gives the reader a vivid shorthand of how fractured Spector\u2019s mind is \u2013 especially when the different art styles begin to clash on the same page. Lemire embraces the entire history of the character and attempts to form it into a single, cohesive narrative. If you\u2019ve never read a Moon Knight comic before, the final arc of this series also retells Spector\u2019s origin story, from the first time his identity disorder manifests to his resurrection by Khonshu. The series is also a fairly short one, clocking in at just 14 issues, and was recently re-released as a complete collection. If you want to read one of, if not the best Moon Knight stories ever published, or just want a great superhero book, this comic won\u2019t disappoint. You can buy Moon Knight by Lemire and Smallwood: The Complete Collection here : Amazon Australia ($50.62) | Book Depository ($59.82) | Booktopia ($57.50) Are there any other Moon Knight comics you should read? Image: Moon Knight #1 (2006) cover, David Finch/Marvel Comics The 2006 Moon Knight series written by Charlie Huston and drawn by David Finch, takes a more gritty, street-level approach to the character. With Finch\u2019s grim art, Huston writes a considerably more brooding and violent version of the character than in previous stories and focuses on Moon Knight losing his connection to Khonshu along with his grip on his sanity. If you ever wanted to read a Marvel comic where a hero peels off a guy\u2019s face, this is the book for you. The most recent Moon Knight series by Jed Mackay and Alessandro Cappuccio has also been a real blast. This version of the character has opened the \u201cMidnight Mission\u201d, a temple dedicated to the teachings of Khonshu, while also embracing his role as \u201cthe defender of those who travel at night\u201d. Mr. Knight takes it upon himself to protect anyone who requests his help, which involves him facing off against vampires and Hunter\u2019s Moon, the second fist of Khonshu. And, no, those comic panels where Moon Knight calls Dracula a \u201cbig fucking nerd\u201d aren\u2019t real. The truth hurts, I know. Moon Knight will be streaming on Disney+ from 30 March.",

            "content": "\u2716The last few days of Winter have melted away, and that means it's time to get ready for the new wave of anime coming in the Spring 2022 anime schedule! 2021 was one of the strongest anime years in recent memory, and that unfortunately has put a lot of pressure on 2022 to somehow keep up that pace. Nevertheless, the Winter 2021 anime schedule had not only major blockbusters showing off some very impressive episodes, but also had a few major new debuts that really caught fans' attention. It's a tough act to follow, yet Spring looks up to the task. It's just going to go about it in a different way. Looking at the Spring 2022 anime slate as a whole outlines a few major patterns. It's a season mostly dominated by returning series, but in a much different way than you'd expect. There are fewer major action franchises, and instead many of the most anticipated debuts or returns are comedies, romantic or otherwise. Even with that said, there's a widespread variety of the types of comedies, action shows, and even a few mysterious thrillers this time around. With so many new shows to keep an eye out for, ComicBook.com is here to help with our picks for the Top 10 Most Anticipated anime of the Spring 2022 season. Could not fit every major release into this list, of course, so let us know your picks! Which shows are you most excited to see? Let us know all of your thoughts about it in the comments! You can even reach out to me directly about all things animated and other cool stuff @Valdezology on Twitter! Tomodachi Game Release Date: April 5th (Crunchyroll) If the likes of Squid Game on Netflix caught your interest, then here's another game that might scratch that itch. Based on Mikoto Yamaguchi and Yuki Sato's original manga series, Tomodachi Game pulls a close group of five friends into a mysterious game. It's revealed that one of them is secretly millions of dollars deep in debt, and thus has signed them up for the chance at clearing that debt with a series of mysterious games. Each game challenges their friendship, and soon secrets are revealed, drama sparks and much more. It could scratch that much needed suspense itch. Crunchyroll describes Tomodachi Game as such, \"High school student Katagiri Yuichi, who values friendship above all else, enjoys a fulfilling life with his close friends Sawaragi Shiho, Mikasa Tenji, Shibe Makoto, and Kokorogi Yutori. However, after a particular incident, they're dragged into a debt repayment game.\" prevnext The Rising of the Shield Hero Season 2 Release Date: April 6th (Crunchyroll) Serving as the marquee action franchise for the season, The Rising of the Shield Hero has finally returned with Season 2. The debut anime season was one of the hugest hits when it landed a few years ago, and the wait for its second season has been particularly tough. Originally scheduled to release in Fall 2021 before finally releasing in the Spring 2022 anime schedule, Naofumi is setting out on the biggest mission yet. After finding out the true secret of the Waves at the end of the first season, Aneko Yusagi's original light novel series has opened up. Naofumi's party is getting bigger, there's a new mission involving a giant sacred turtle, and if the first season was anything to go by there are bound to be some impressive sequences if it all works out for the best. It's definitely going to take up most conversation this season. prevnext Tiger & Bunny 2 Release Date: April 8th (Netflix) Another major action franchise making its return is Tiger & Bunny. It's been an even more painful of a wait for more of this franchise as it's been ten long years since the release of the Tiger & Bunny movie. Finally returning for a proper second season of the anime, Tiger & Bunny 2 takes place years after the events of that first season and follows Wild Tiger and Barnaby as they try to adjust with the changes that have been made to the professional hero world over the years. Younger and newer heroes, more challenges, and lots of cool hero action will be coming to Netflix! Netflix describes Tiger & Bunny 2 as such, \"Fighting for peace -- and their sponsors -- the odd couple of Wild Tiger and Barnaby continue to work as superheroes. But with the number of superheroes increasing around the world, how will these two veterans fare!?\" prevnext Date A Live Season 4 Release Date: April 8th (Crunchyroll) It's a pretty big season for returns overall as yet another major franchise is returning for a new season too. Date A Live has had one of the more interesting anime past thus far as all three of its seasons were handled by three different production studios. That trend continues with the returning fourth season of the series that introduces Shido to new Spirits who he'll need to charm before they pose an even greater danger. Basically, it's going to be more of what fans loved in the first three seasons...but more of it! Crunchyroll describes Date A Live IV as such, \"With multiple Spirits now living with him, Shido's juggling act of giving ladies attention is never-ending. On top of that, more Spirits arrive for him to put the charm on. As he seals more and more, with his intentions unknown to them, will he be able to keep this up or will it lead to one big, giant spatial quake?\" prevnext Love After World Domination Release Date: April 8th (Crunchyroll) There are a few unique looking romantic comedies making their debut this season too. Fans might have noticed how the romantic comedy genre in general has been evolving in some pretty fun ways. It's been a shake up of core premises, and one unique take comes from Hiroshi Noda and Takahiro Wakamatsu's original manga, Love After World Domination. This story sees the leader of a Power Rangers like team falling in love with one of the major villains they fight each week. The two of them then need to hide their love from their respective sides lest they have to break up. The secret to a great romantic comedy is getting a couple early on and then watching their relationship develop, and blending that with a lot of potential for fun Power Rangers type shenanigans could make for an interesting watch this season. prevnext Kaguya-sama: Love is War Season 3 Release Date: April 9th (Crunchyroll) The leading return for the romantic comedy fans is certainly Kaguya-sama: Love is War -Ultra Romantic-. The second season of the series came to an end with a mysterious tease for a third, but it wasn't until last year that a third season was actually confirmed to be in the works. Kaguya Shinomiya and Miyuki Shirogane have grown closer than ever before with the first two seasons, but at the same time they have become more stubborn to share their feelings too! If you were a fan of the wacky romantic shenanigans in those first seasons, this one will be right up your alley. Crunchyroll describes Kaguya-sama: Love is War -Ultra Romantic- as such, \"Shuchiin Academy--an elite school where the most gifted students flock to. It is also where its Student Council brought together Vice President Kaguya Shinomiya and President Miyuki Shirogane. While everyone expected a speedy courtship and agreed that the two geniuses would make the perfect couple, the pair, it seems, has too much pride to confess their true feelings for one another! The two remain fully committed in devising a highly cerebral strategy in this cunning war of love... Will they take their relationship to the next level by the final day of Shuchiin Academy's culture festival!?\" prevnext Spy x Family Release Date: April 9th (Crunchyroll) The Spring season might be mostly dominated by some major franchise returns, but there are some debuts that are just as big. Tatsuya Endo's original manga series has built up quite a cult following since it debuted in Shueisha's Jump+ app a couple of years ago, and it has been such a notable run that many felt like an anime adaptation was inevitable. What has been a surprise, however, is seeing just how much has been put behind bringing it to life. A joint production between WIT Studio (the studio behind Ranking of Kings, Vinland Saga and much more) and CloverWorks (which produced My Dress-Up Darling, Horimiya and more), Spy x Family is getting off on the right foot. Kicking off with an international spy needing to quickly put together a family in order to somehow get closer to an elusive political target, Spy x Family has everything you need. With its central trio of a super spy, deadly assassin, and telepathic child navigating their new family life while trying to keep their individual secrets, it all quickly results in action, hilarious misunderstandings, and even some romance! This will be the big one, folks. prevnext Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie Release Date: April 9th (Crunchyroll) Before each new seasonal schedule begins, there is usually one or two new anime series that really strike a chord with fans. Whether it's revealed that a cult following has been actually waiting a long time for an adaptation, or something about its premise and promotional materials catch fans' eyes right away. This time around that seems to be happening quite a bit with Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. Based on Keigo Maki's original manga series, the titular Shikimori is the girlfriend of the main character, Izumi, who is revealed to be more than her cute looks would imply. It's the type of romantic comedy dynamic that has become especially popular in recent seasons with shows like Don't Toy With Me, Miss Nagatoro, Teasing Master Takagi-san, and Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! (to a lesser extent), and clearly the audience is ready for a harder edged take on that type of main love interest. Now it's just a matter of seeing how far such a premise actually takes the series. There's a lot of romantic comedy competition, but this might have the right angle to stand out. prevnext Komi Can't Communicate Season 2 Release Date: April 27th in the U.S., April 7th in Japan The final of the major returning romantic comedies this Spring us also one of the more recent hits. Tomohito Oda's Komi Can't Communicate had a major cult following for its manga run, but its anime debut last year catapulted it into a whole new territory. It's one of the rare Netflix licenses that has the streaming service releases episodes on a weekly basis a few weeks after their initial premiere. It was a must-watch for that reason alone, but then you're introduced to the titular Shoko Komi and her wacky classmates and even wackier world. Seeking to make 100 friends, the slice of life comedy will be bringing even more wacky characters, introduce Komi to fun new activities, and see her getting closer to accomplishing her dream all while having fun on the way. It's going to be the major unwinding anime fans will need every week. prevnext Summer Time Rendering Release Date: April 15th (Disney+ in Japan, TBA for other countries) {replyCount}commentsThis pick is sort of a cheat, unfortunately, but we have to talk about it. It's streaming on Disney+ in Japan alongside its initial TV debut, but unfortunately international territories will have to wait a bit longer. This release is certainly one to watch for that Disney+ novelty alone, but Summer Time Rendering doesn't really need it to provide a great hook. Based on Yasuki Tanaka's original manga series, this series follows Shinpei, a boy who ended up growing up together with a pair of sisters, Ushio and Mio, following the death of his parents. Years later, Ushio drowns in a mysterious accident and Shinpei heads back to his small island hometown. But he soon figures out that Ushio's death wasn't exactly an accident and thus goes on a chase to figure out what's happening in his town. The series will be adapting the entire manga by the time it's over, so this is definitely one that fans might want to binge through when it drops outside of Japan. Until then, we'll have to keep an eye on it from afar. prev",

The two remain fully committed in devising a highly cerebral strategy in this cunning war of love... Will they take their relationship to the next level by the final day of Shuchiin Academy's culture festival!?\" prev next Spy x Family Release Date: April 9th (Crunchyroll) The Spring season might be mostly dominated by some major franchise returns, but there are some debuts that are just as big. Tatsuya Endo's original manga series has built up quite a cult following since it debuted in Shueisha's Jump+ app a couple of years ago, and it has been such a notable run that many felt like an anime adaptation was inevitable. What has been a surprise, however, is seeing just how much has been put behind bringing it to life. A joint production between WIT Studio (the studio behind Ranking of Kings, Vinland Saga and much more) and CloverWorks (which produced My Dress-Up Darling, Horimiya and more), Spy x Family is getting off on the right foot. Kicking off with an international spy needing to quickly put together a family in order to somehow get closer to an elusive political target, Spy x Family has everything you need. With its central trio of a super spy, deadly assassin, and telepathic child navigating their new family life while trying to keep their individual secrets, it all quickly results in action, hilarious misunderstandings, and even some romance! This will be the big one, folks. prev next Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie Release Date: April 9th (Crunchyroll) Before each new seasonal schedule begins, there is usually one or two new anime series that really strike a chord with fans. Whether it's revealed that a cult following has been actually waiting a long time for an adaptation, or something about its premise and promotional materials catch fans' eyes right away. This time around that seems to be happening quite a bit with Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie . Based on Keigo Maki's original manga series, the titular Shikimori is the girlfriend of the main character, Izumi, who is revealed to be more than her cute looks would imply. It's the type of romantic comedy dynamic that has become especially popular in recent seasons with shows like Don't Toy With Me, Miss Nagatoro, Teasing Master Takagi-san, and Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! (to a lesser extent), and clearly the audience is ready for a harder edged take on that type of main love interest. Now it's just a matter of seeing how far such a premise actually takes the series. There's a lot of romantic comedy competition, but this might have the right angle to stand out. prev next Komi Can't Communicate Season 2 Release Date: April 27th in the U.S., April 7th in Japan The final of the major returning romantic comedies this Spring us also one of the more recent hits. Tomohito Oda's Komi Can't Communicate had a major cult following for its manga run, but its anime debut last year catapulted it into a whole new territory. It's one of the rare Netflix licenses that has the streaming service releases episodes on a weekly basis a few weeks after their initial premiere. It was a must-watch for that reason alone, but then you're introduced to the titular Shoko Komi and her wacky classmates and even wackier world. Seeking to make 100 friends, the slice of life comedy will be bringing even more wacky characters, introduce Komi to fun new activities, and see her getting closer to accomplishing her dream all while having fun on the way. It's going to be the major unwinding anime fans will need every week. prev next Summer Time Rendering Release Date: April 15th (Disney+ in Japan, TBA for other countries) 0 comments This pick is sort of a cheat, unfortunately, but we have to talk about it. It's streaming on Disney+ in Japan alongside its initial TV debut, but unfortunately international territories will have to wait a bit longer. This release is certainly one to watch for that Disney+ novelty alone, but Summer Time Rendering doesn't really need it to provide a great hook. Based on Yasuki Tanaka's original manga series, this series follows Shinpei, a boy who ended up growing up together with a pair of sisters, Ushio and Mio, following the death of his parents. Years later, Ushio drowns in a mysterious accident and Shinpei heads back to his small island hometown. But he soon figures out that Ushio's death wasn't exactly an accident and thus goes on a chase to figure out what's happening in his town. The series will be adapting the entire manga by the time it's over, so this is definitely one that fans might want to binge through when it drops outside of Japan. Until then, we'll have to keep an eye on it from afar. prev",

            "content": "After a series of delays setting the movie back a couple of years, Morbius is just around the corner (truly, it\u2019s now only two sleeps away). But who is this villain that most people haven\u2019t heard of from the Spider-Man comics? Well, here\u2019s who he is and how Morbius fits into the MCU and the other Spider-Man films. Courtesy note, though \u2013 the movie isn\u2019t out yet, so there will be no spoilers for Morbius in this article. However, we will be touching on Spider-Man: No Way Home briefly down below. First, some trailers Here\u2019s the official trailer for Morbius. Two years ago, this teaser trailer was released for Morbius, largely made up of the same clips. Lastly, as if there was anything left to show in the film, we got the final trailer. window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_1_mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); If you\u2019re hungry for more, we also got this bonus clip. What\u2019s the deal with Morbius? We get quite a detailed idea for what the movie is about in the trailers \u2013 Dr. Michael Morbius (played by Jared Leto), a disabled doctor with a rare blood disease who sets off to find a cure for his disability, becomes a vampire when he discovers said cure, seeking to push the boundaries of health and science. He gets super strength, speed and \u201csome form of bat radar\u201d, at the cost of becoming a blood-sucking vampire. It also looks to be quite a gory affair. Also, for whatever reason, Michael Keaton appears to be in this movie \u2013 he played the villain in Spider-Man: Homecoming, which is admittedly a separate Spider-Man universe (the MCU) but could still be linked through the multiverse. Also, this movie is in the same universe as Venom, as the last few seconds of the official trailer indicate. These films are linked by \u201cSony\u2019s Spider-Man Universe\u201d (actual name). As far as I can tell, the only new stuff in the final trailer is an extra couple of seconds with Matt Smith, who plays Loxias Crown, Mobius\u2019 friend who suffers from the same blood disease (and clearly ends up getting the same superpowers), screaming about killing all the people in the world who had the gall to not be dying of a rare blood disease. But wait. What\u2019s that? Image: Sony Pictures From the second trailer, that appears to be Tobey Maguire\u2019s Spider-Man \u2013 or, for whatever reason, could be Andrew Garfield\u2019s Spider-Man, with \u201cMurderer\u201d graffitied over the poster. window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_1_hpu-mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); That\u2019s VERY interesting. So what you\u2019re saying is that there could be a Spider-Man in Sony\u2019s Spider-Man Universe? Shocking! We don\u2019t get another glimpse of Spider-Man in this trailer, but that could change when the movie comes out. Back to less multiversal stuff, the movie seems to pick up on the beats of the original comic Morbius quite well, applying a modern flair to the extravagant vampire of older Marvel comics. He has an undying thirst for human blood, caught between humanity and vampirism. It looks to be a cross between a monster flick and a superhero film, very much like Venom. Image: Sony Pictures But while we\u2019re getting swept up in it all, it\u2019s worth remembering what happened the last time someone tried to adapt Morbius. We\u2019re going into spoiler territory for Spider-Man: No Way Home below, so just watch out. Where does this all fit into the MCU? Not at all, is the short answer, but the long answer is that Morbius is strenuously tied to the MCU through whatever Spider-Man was shown in that poster. Considering No Way Home was about a wider multiverse (and a Spider-Verse) featuring Tom Holland, Tobey Macquire and Andrew Garfield, it\u2019s entirely possible that there is some connection to be made between Morbius and the MCU. For all intents and purposes, though, Morbius exists within Sony\u2019s Spider-Man Universe. But why is Morbius\u2018 director hinting otherwise? There\u2019s also a bit of a tangled web of every Spider-Man movie currently in the works. We might be proven wrong here, but we wouldn\u2019t hate that. Speaking to Digital Spy, director Daniel Espinosa joked about Marvel secrecy while revealing the big MCU plot point he had to carefully guard. window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_2_mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); \u201cI had moments where they would take me into a room in the lot which is soundproof and they\u2019d inject a small chip into your brain and they\u2019d tell you certain things and then you\u2019re allowed to exit,\u201d he joked during the DS interview. \u201cYou have to know certain things about where things are guided, but they allowed me to develop the idea of the picture and also the style. \u201cMorbius should be a very unique character and it should be an outsider. I wanted to have the opportunity to do my own New York and keep a bit of my version of what this side of Marvel should be.\u201d Who is starring in Morbius? To recap: Jared Leto will play the titular Dr. Michael Morbius, with Jared Harris as Emil Nikols, Adria Arjona as Martine Bancroft, Tyrese Gibson as Simon Stroud and Matt Smith as Loxias Crown. Very excited to see one of the actors who played Doctor Who as a villain. Michael Keaton will also be appearing in an unnamed role. Morbius release date Morbius will officially release in Australia on 31 March, after being delayed from January. It\u2019s two years since the original expected release of Morbius and four years since the movie was announced. Altogether, this is its seventh delay. Ultimately, these delays are trivial, but they admittedly hit hard for the superhero genre. To make it a little easier to digest, we decided to look back at some of the most infamous delays that superhero movies have faced in recent years. Reception so far Recently, we were hyped for Uncharted and boy did that movie adaptation miss the mark. We really, really hope this isn\u2019t the case with Morbius. But those who have had early access to the flick have reported, for the most part, Morbius is not good. Chief complaints include dodgy CGI, poor storytelling and an uneven tone. The post-credit scenes have been called \u201csome of the WORST you\u2019ve ever seen\u201d. Here\u2019s what Espinosa had to say on those post-credit scenes. There\u2019s also not too much praise for Leto, but the response to Matt Smith\u2019s over-the-top villain seems to be positive. Let\u2019s see what Thursday brings.

A fully charged torrential arrow will deal Hydro damage. Additionally, Yelan will enter a \u201cBreakthrough\u201d state after spending 5-seconds off-field, which will cause her next Charged Aimed Shot to have 80% decreased charge time. Once charged, she can fire a \u201cBreakthrough Barb\u201d that will deal AoE Hydro damage based on Yelan\u2019s max HP. Plunging Attack: Yelan fires off a flurry of arrows in mid-air before falling and striking the ground, dealing AoE damage upon impact. Yelan Elemental Skill \u2013 Lingering Lifeline Yelan fires off a Lifeline that tractors her in rapidly, entangling and marking opponents along its path. When her rapid movement ends, the Lifeline will explode, dealing Hydro DMG to the marked opponents based on her Max HP. Read More: Genshin Impact Version 2.7 details During this time, she can control her sprint direction and can end her rapid movement by using this Skill again. Additionally, each opponent marked by the Lifeline when it explodes grants Yelan a 34% chance to obtain Breakthrough.

If you wish to use the Valley Orchid as your main form of damage, then you can\u2019t go wrong with the Heart of Depth Artifact set. This set increases the Hydro DMG Bonus by 15%. Meanwhile, the four-piece increases Normal Attack and Charged Attack DMG by 30% for 15 seconds whenever she uses her Elemental Skill. Not only will it enhance her Hydro attacks, but it will also reward you with even more damage whenever you unleash her Elemental Skill. Combine this with the decreased charge time from her \u201cBreakthrough\u201d state and you have a recipe for success.

There\u2019s always the choice of running the standard Noblesse Oblige set for 20% Elemental Burst damage and 20% team attack buff. This set is great for those looking to use Yelan as support that can still dish out plenty of damage. Lastly, the Blizzard Strayer set is for those that wish to use Yelan in Freeze comps. When a character attacks an opponent affected by Cryo, their Crit Rate is increased by 20%. If the opponent is Frozen, Crit Rate is increased by an additional 20%. It\u2019s also important to note that HoYoverse could even add a new Artifact set that is tailor-made for Yelan, so we\u2019ll be sure to update this section as soon as new information is released. Artifact Details Heart of Depth 2-Piece: Hydro DMG Bonus +15% 4-Piece: After using an Elemental Skill, increases Normal Attack and Charged Attack DMG by 30% for 15s.

If the opponent is Frozen, Crit Rate is increased by an additional 20%. Best Yelan weapons in Genshin Impact Yelan is a powerful Bow user who excels at bombarding her enemies with well-aimed charged shots, which means you\u2019ll want a weapon that can maximize her charged attack damage. As a result, her best option is Amos\u2019 Bow. This lethal 5-star Bow increases Normal Attack and Charged Attack DMG by 18%. After a Normal or Charged Attack is fired, DMG dealt increases by a further 12% every 0.1 seconds the arrow is in the air. Read More: Genshin Impact banner: What is the current banner & who will be next?

However, getting your hands on both of these 5-star Bows can prove tricky, especially if you\u2019re a F2P player.

Yelan gameplay in Genshin Impact Yelan gameplay from Genshin_Impact_Leaks While HoYoverse has yet to officially reveal any Yelan gameplay, a video showcasing her Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst has cropped up online. The footage above shows how Yelan will use Lingering Lifeline and Depth-Clarion Dice to unleash mayhem on the battlefield. Read More: Best Ayato Genshin Impact build Like most leaks, the footage above represents an early build of Yelan. This means the developers could change her kit before her rumored 2.7 release date, so be sure to take the footage with a grain of salt. Best Yelan team comp HoYoverseHu Tao works wonders alongside the Valley Orchid. The best Yelan team comp can fulfill plenty of roles, but we\u2019ve opted for a deadly Vaporize team that can stop enemies dead in their tracks. This team utilizes Hu Tao, Xingqiu, and Zhongli. Both Yelan and Xingqiu will be able to constantly soak enemies, which will enable Hu Tao to apply her Pyro abilities. In turn, all foes that are subsequently engulfed by Hu Tao\u2019s fiery abilities will receive additional damage. Lastly, Zhongli\u2019s shields greatly increase Hu Tao survivability. This enables you to constantly apply pressure, even when your health is low.

Yelan gameplay in Genshin Impact Yelan gameplay from Genshin_Impact_Leaks While HoYoverse has yet to officially reveal any Yelan gameplay, a video showcasing her Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst has cropped up online. The footage above shows how Yelan will use Lingering Lifeline and Depth-Clarion Dice to unleash mayhem on the battlefield.

Best Yelan team comp HoYoverse Hu Tao works wonders alongside the Valley Orchid. The best Yelan team comp can fulfill plenty of roles, but we\u2019ve opted for a deadly Vaporize team that can stop enemies dead in their tracks. This team utilizes Hu Tao , Xingqiu , and Zhongli . Both Yelan and Xingqiu will be able to constantly soak enemies, which will enable Hu Tao to apply her Pyro abilities. In turn, all foes that are subsequently engulfed by Hu Tao\u2019s fiery abilities will receive additional damage. Lastly, Zhongli\u2019s shields greatly increase Hu Tao survivability.

            "content": "The rise in rhino population in Kaziranga is cheering news for nature lovers. For the authorities of Kaziranga National Park, it also brings new challenges to the management of the rhino habitats, fodder availability and conservation of its rich biodiversity. Balancing the increasing flow of tourists to the World Heritage Site and conservation strategies for its management has also become an enormous task for the park authorities. The latest Census of rhinos at the national park estimates the total population at 2,613 compared to 2413 rhinos estimated during the 2018 Census. The increase in population by 200 rhinos over four years contrasted to an increase of 12 rhinos in 2018 over 2015 estimates is reflective of conservation efforts, including tough anti-poaching measures by park authorities and the Assam government. The State government by burning a stockpile of 2479 seized, confiscated, and recovered rhino horns had sent a strong message against poaching as it busts the myth of rhino horns having medicinal value. Sighting of an increased population of the vulnerable species even after the natural death of an estimated 400 rhinos and three due to poaching since the last census is a pointer in that direction. However, fewer sighting in 2018 was also attributed to the incomplete burning of grasses before the Census which cannot be overlooked and estimates of the next Census will reveal the actual trajectory of the growth in the population of one-horned rhinos in the park. Assam cabinet's approval to draft notification of the integrated eco-sensitive zone around the Kaziranga tiger reserve, seven protected areas adjacent to it and delineation of nine animal corridors is a significant step to boost conservation efforts. Eco-sensitive zones act like shock absorbers of protected areas by the way of prohibition, and regulation of anthropogenic activities for the environment and ecological security. Building awareness among local people living on the fringe of the national park and in the proposed eco-sensitive zone on conservation measures is critical to sustaining the success story. The delineation of the animal corridors alone is not going to facilitate the smooth migration of park animals during floods across the National Highway 37 in search of food and shelter towards the high lands of the Karbi Anglong-Kaziranga landscape. Regulating traffic along the highway is a stop-gap arrangement and has not been proved a hundred per cent effective in the complete curb of park animals getting killed and injured in incidents of vehicle-hit due to reckless driving in violation of the speed limit and ignoring appeal to drive cautiously while passing over the animal corridors. The proposal to construct an elevated road over the stretch from Jakhalabandha in the West and Kohora in the East with flyovers and animal overpass triggered hopes of an alternative and long-term solution to regulated traffic but is yet to get the Central Government's nod. Park authorities have been pushing for the removal of settlements near the animal corridors. The comprehensive planning for rehabilitation and compensation for relocation of the settlements is crucial for proposed investments for alternative traffic movement through the park landscape to ensure smooth migration of animals and the entire 39-km stretch of the existing NH serving as a highland serving as a shelter for rhino and other animals escaping flood fury. The national park received the highest footfall of 2.20 lakh in 2021-22 over the past 12 years and revenue collected from tourists touching the Rs 4.5 lakh mark calls for a scientific review to rule out that the park's capacity has not been stretched to the limit with a jump in inflow of tourists. The Kaziranga tiger reserve bearing a healthy tiger population and high density of tigers leading to frequent sightings of tigers is also believed to have attracted more tourists to the national park. With international travel destinations remaining out of bounding due to COVID-19 restrictions, more domestic tourists have flocked to the rhino habitats and if the latest trend inflow of tourists is going to hold will be known only during the next tourism season provided other countries also fully unlocks and global disruptions caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict gets over by then. The rise in rhino population reminds the park authorities about the long-term strategy that is needed for the management of its grassland to ensure that the species does not face fodder shortage. Invasive species like mimosa and water hyacinth overgrowth in wetlands of the rhino habitat cause ecological degradation of the habitat adding to the problem of fodder management. While declining incidents of poaching do not allow lowering of the guards, management of the ecological landscape entails undertaking more scientific studies and research and deployment of trained professionals besides technology adoption which requires adequate funding by the central and Assam government. Kaziranga needs an updated roadmap of a robust conservation strategy to cater to the challenges and opportunities brought about by the rise in rhino population and increasing footfall in the national park bearing the world's largest one-horned rhino population.",

            "content": "Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa is a prime candidate in the search for life. The frozen moon has a subsurface ocean, and evidence indicates it\u2019s warm, salty, and rich in life-enabling chemistry. New research shows that the moon is pulling oxygen down below its icy shell, where it could be feeding simple life. Whether or not Europa can sustain life in its subsurface ocean is highly debatable, and the debate is essentially stuck in neutral until NASA sends the Europa Clipper there. The mission to Europa has to be meticulously designed, and NASA bases part of the design on what specific questions scientists want the Clipper to address. We can\u2019t send a spacecraft to Europa and tell it to find life. NASA designs missions with big questions in mind, but they can only answer smaller, specific questions. So scientists are studying different aspects of Europa and performing simulations to fine-tune the questions they need the mission to ask. Oxygen is at the heart of one of those questions. It might be the final piece in understanding Europa\u2019s habitability. Europa has, or we think it has, most of what life needs to sustain itself. Water is the prime ingredient, and it has an abundance of water in its subsurface ocean. Europa has more water than Earth\u2019s oceans. It also has the required chemical nutrients. Life needs energy, and Europa\u2019s energy source is tidal flexing from Jupiter, which heats its interior and stops the ocean from freezing solid. These are pretty well-established facts to most scientists. The frozen moon also has oxygen at its surface, another intriguing hint of habitability. The oxygen is generated when sunlight and charged particles from Jupiter strike the moon\u2019s surface. But there\u2019s a problem: Europa\u2019s thick ice sheet is a barrier between oxygen and the ocean. Europa\u2019s surface is frozen solid, so any life would have to be in its vast ocean. How can oxygen make its way from the surface to the ocean? When charged particles strike Europa\u2019s surface, they split water molecules apart. The lighter hydrogen floats away into space, but the oxygen stays behind. If the oxygen somehow makes its way to the ocean, it could provide chemical energy for microbial life. Image Credit: NASA According to a new research letter, pools of saltwater in Europa\u2019s icy shell could be transporting the oxygen from the surface to the ocean. The research letter is \u201cDownward Oxidant Transport Through Europa\u2019s Ice Shell by Density-Driven Brine Percolation,\u201d published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. The lead author is Marc Hesse, a professor at the UT Jackson School of Geosciences Department of Geological Sciences. These briny pools exist in places in the shell where some ice melts due to convection currents in the ocean. Europa\u2019s famous and photogenic chaos terrain forms above these pools. Chaos terrain covers about 25% of Europa\u2019s frozen surface. Chaos terrain is where ridges, cracks, faults, and plains are jumbled together. There\u2019s no clear understanding of the exact causes of chaos terrain, though it\u2019s likely related to uneven subsurface heating and melting. Some of Europa\u2019s most iconic images highlight this strangely beautiful feature. Image of Europa\u2019s ice shell, taken by the Galileo spacecraft, of fractured \u201cchaos terrain.\u201d Saltwater pools below chaos terrain may be transporting oxygen to the moon\u2019s ocean. Image Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech Scientists think Europa\u2019s ice sheet is about 15 to 25 km (10 to 15 miles) thick. A 2011 study found that chaos terrain on Europa may be located above vast lakes of liquid water as little as 3 km (1.9 miles) below the ice. These lakes aren\u2019t directly connected to the subsurface ocean but can drain into them. According to this new study, the briny lakes can mix with surface oxygen and over time, can deliver large quantities of oxygen to the deeper subsurface ocean. This figure from the study shows how oxidants are generated and distributed in Europa\u2019s surface ice. Radiolysis sputters H2O into H2 and O, with O recombining into O2. Some of the O2 is released into the moon\u2019s atmosphere, but most of it returns to the icy regolith and is trapped in bubbles. The bubbles are the dominant near-surface reservoir for oxidants. Over thousands of years, the bubbles can make their way down to the ocean. Image Credit: Hesse et al. 2022. \u201cOur research puts this process into the realm of the possible,\u201d said Hesse. \u201cIt provides a solution to what is considered one of the outstanding problems of the habitability of the Europa subsurface ocean.\u201d The researchers showed how oxygen is transported through the ice in their simulation. The oxygen-laden brine moves to the subsurface ocean in a porosity wave. A porosity wave transports the brine through the ice by momentarily widening the pores in the ice before quickly sealing up again. Over thousands of years, these porosity waves transport the oxygen-rich brine to the ocean. The physics-based model built by the researchers shows a porosity wave (spherical shape) carrying brine and oxygen at Europa\u2019s surface through the moon\u2019s ice shell to the liquid water ocean below. The chart shows time (in thousands of years) and ice shell depth (in kilometres). Red indicates higher levels of oxygen. Blue represents lower levels of oxygen. Credit: Hesse et al. 2022 The relationship between chaos terrain and oxygen transport is not completely clear. But scientists think that convective upwellings caused by tidal heating partially melt the ice, manifesting as the jumbled chaos terrain on the surface. The ice under the brine must be molten or partially molten for the oxygen-rich brine to drain into the ocean. \u201cFor these brines to drain, the underlying ice must be permeable and thus partially molten. Previous studies show that tidal heating increases the temperature of upwellings in the convecting portion of Europa\u2019s ice shell to the melting point of pure ice,\u201d the authors write. \u201cGiven that chaotic terrains likely form over diapiric upwellings, it is plausible that the underlying ice is partially molten,\u201d the letter says. The presence of NaCl in the connecting ice likely increases the melt. Europa\u2019s surface is bitterly cold but not cold enough to refreeze so quickly that oxygen can\u2019t be transported in brines. At the moon\u2019s poles, the temperature never rises above minus 220 C (370 F.) But the model\u2019s results \u201c\u2026 demonstrate that refreezing at the surface is too slow to arrest the drainage of the brine and prevent oxidant delivery to the internal ocean.\u201d Though Europa\u2019s surface ice is frozen solid, the ice under it is convective, which delays freezing. And some research shows that the seafloor may be volcanic. This illustration shows how volcanism in Europa\u2019s interior might work to maintain a liquid ocean. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/Michael Carroll The study says that about 86% of the oxygen taken up at Europa\u2019s surface makes it to the ocean. Over the moon\u2019s history, that percentage could have shifted widely. But the highest estimate produced by the researchers\u2019 model creates an oxygen-rich ocean very similar to Earth\u2019s. Could something be living under the ice? Artist\u2019s impression of a hypothetical ocean cryobot (a robot capable of penetrating water ice) in Europa. Credit: NASA \u201cIt\u2019s enticing to think of some kind of aerobic organisms living just under the ice,\u201d said co-author Steven Vance, a research scientist at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and the supervisor of its Planetary Interiors and Geophysics Group. Kevin Hand is one of the many scientists keenly interested in Europa, its potential for life, and the upcoming Europa Clipper mission. Hand is a NASA/JPL scientist whose work focuses on Europa. He\u2019s hopeful that Hesse and his fellow researchers have solved the problem of oxygen in the frozen moon\u2019s oceans. \u201cWe know that Europa has useful compounds like oxygen on its surface, but do those make it down into the ocean below, where life can use them?\u201d he asked. \u201cIn the work by Hesse and his collaborators, the answer seems to be yes.\u201d What questions can the Europa Clipper ask that might confirm these findings? The Clipper is the first mission dedicated to Europa. We think we know many things about Europa that we haven\u2019t been able to confirm. The Clipper is designed to address three larger objectives: Investigate the ocean\u2019s composition to determine if it has the necessary components to sustain life.Investigate the moon\u2019s geology to understand how the surface formed, including the chaos terrain. Determine the ice shell\u2019s thickness and if there\u2019s liquid water within and beneath it. They also will determine how the ocean interacts with the surface: Does anything in the ocean rise through the shell to the top? Does any material from the surface work its way down into the ocean? That last point speaks to the potential transport of oxygen from the surface to the ocean. The Europa Clipper will carry ten instruments that will work together to address these questions. The MAss SPectrometer for Planetary EXploration/Europa (MASPEX) is particularly interesting when it comes to oxygen transport on Europa. \u201cMASPEX will gain crucial answers from gases near Europa, such as the chemistry of Europa\u2019s surface, atmosphere, and suspected ocean,\u201d the instrument\u2019s web page explains. \u201cMASPEX will study how Jupiter\u2019s radiation alters Europa\u2019s surface compounds and how the surface and ocean exchange material.\u201d MASPEX, and the rest of Europa Clipper\u2019s instruments, might confirm oxygen transport from the surface to the ocean, where life could use it if life exists there. But we\u2019ll have to wait a while. Europa Clipper is scheduled to launch in October 2024 and won\u2019t reach the Jupiter system until 5.5 years later. Once there, its science phase is expected to last four years. So it could be 2034 before we have all the data. In the meantime, research like this will whet our appetites.

The MAss SPectrometer for Planetary EXploration/Europa (MASPEX) is particularly interesting when it comes to oxygen transport on Europa. \u201cMASPEX will gain crucial answers from gases near Europa, such as the chemistry of Europa\u2019s surface, atmosphere, and suspected ocean,\u201d the instrument\u2019s web page explains. \u201cMASPEX will study how Jupiter\u2019s radiation alters Europa\u2019s surface compounds and how the surface and ocean exchange material.\u201d MASPEX, and the rest of Europa Clipper\u2019s instruments, might confirm oxygen transport from the surface to the ocean, where life could use it if life exists there. But we\u2019ll have to wait a while. Europa Clipper is scheduled to launch in October 2024 and won\u2019t reach the Jupiter system until 5.5 years later. Once there, its science phase is expected to last four years. So it could be 2034 before we have all the data. In the meantime, research like this will whet our appetites.",

Geomagnetic activity is expected to spike due to two colossal eruptions of solar flares from a sun spot which briefly faced the Earth. Space weather centres are predicting a G3 magnetic storm, classed as \u2018strong\u2019 on the range from G1 to G5, supercharging the disturbances in the planet\u2019s magnetic sphere which cause the eyecatching phenomenon. The spike began in the early hours of Thursday morning, when much of the UK\u2019s northern areas were under cloud cover, but is expected to peak on the nights of Thursday and Friday. The best chances of seeing it are in Scotland, Northern Ireland and parts of northern England provided skies are clear, the Met Office said. Its forecasters said it was not possible to say for certain whether a given region would have sightings, explaining the likelihood increases the further north you live. Cloud cover forecasts suggest people in western Scotland, Northern Ireland and coastal areas of North-West England and North Yorkshire will have the highest chances of good visibility at around midnight on Thursday. On Friday night most of the UK\u2019s north will be overcast, although much of Yorkshire\u2019s skies are expected to clear up for a time around 10pm. Many people popping out to check the skies will be stepping onto snow after a cold snap saw several centimetres fall onto West Yorkshire and Northumberland and is expected to bring more further south and west. The display reaches its most dazzling in northernmost countries such as Finland (Picture: Getty Images) Temperatures will plummet to an average of around 1C across the UK on Thursday and Friday nights, remaining in the single digits during the daytime, the Met Office added. The boosted Aurora Borealis is \u2018due to the expected disturbance in the Earth\u2019s magnetic environment as a result of two Earth-directed Coronal Mass Ejections or CMEs\u2019, the British Geological Survey said. These CMEs are \u2018cannibal\u2019 types, which is when a solar flare is swallowed up by a second larger flare, resulting in \u2018tangled magnetic fields and compressed plasmas\u2019. The first flare lifted from the sun at around 12.30pm on Monday and the second followed approximately eight hours later. Kirklees in Yorkshire was one of many areas in the North blanketed in snow on Thursday (Picture: PA) The BGS added: \u2018These CMEs are expected to arrive at Earth early on 31st March, causing significant disturbances to the geomagnetic field.\u2019 Astronomers believe the Earth is entering a period of increased solar activity which could peak in 2025. Earlier this year SpaceX confirmed that a geomagnetic storm caused by solar activity destroyed the bulk of a set of Starlink satellites it was trying to fly into orbit. The storm heated and expanded the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, causing a spike in atmospheric drag which pulled the satellites back down to earth. Scientists say this week\u2019s magnetic storms are \u2018unlikely\u2019 to have an impact on the UK\u2019s power grid or other ground technology.

            "content": "The cities of Regina and Saskatoon are looking at putting up as much as $350,000 each to support a bid for the 2023 world junior hockey championship tournament. For Regina Mayor Sandra Masters, it would be money well spent. \u201cThis is unbelievable news, just even the opportunity to bid, having had it pulled from Russia,\u201d she said on Thursday\u2019s Greg Morgan Morning Show. The 2023 tournament was originally scheduled to take place in Novosibirsk, Russia between Dec. 26, 2022 and Jan. 5, 2023. On Feb. 28, the International Ice Hockey Federation announced it was stripping Russia of its hosting rights \u2014 among other things \u2014 due to the ongoing war in Ukraine. Masters believes having the 2023 tournament in Regina would have a big impact on the city in a time of the year where tourism usually dips. \u201cIn terms of visitor economy (and) tourism, especially in the month of December and into January, it would be fantastic,\u201d she said. Regina and Saskatoon city councils both are to hold special meetings Friday morning to consider the options. According to the agenda for Friday\u2019s meeting in Saskatoon, the 2023 tournament would be held in Saskatchewan centres from Dec. 15 to Jan. 2. Regina and Saskatoon have to provide a business plan to Hockey Canada by Monday. A final decision on the tournament\u2019s location is to be made later in April. The money in Regina would come from the city\u2019s Events, Conventions and Tradeshows attraction budget. Saskatoon\u2019s funding would come from the Reserve for Major Special Events. Saskatchewan has played host to the world junior tournament twice before, in 1991 and 2010. According to a letter to city council from Tourism Saskatoon CEO Stephanie Clovechok, the 2010 event was \u201cone of the strongest-producing events in Hockey Canada\u2019s history.\u201d In 2010, Saskatoon played host to games involving Canada as well as the medal round because SaskTel Centre is a bigger venue than Regina\u2019s Brandt Centre. As a result, Saskatoon paid twice as much as Regina \u2014 $500,000 to $250,000 \u2014 to get the tournament. If the 2010 funding model is repeated, Regina\u2019s share in 2023 would be $175,000. Clovechok noted the event would generate as much as $50 million in economic impact, attract more than 300,000 fans to the 31 games, and bring more than 20,000 visitors to Saskatoon for the tournament. \u201cAll 31 games will be broadcast worldwide on TSN/RDS driving over 120 million viewers worldwide, providing international exposure to Saskatoon\u2019s hosting excellence, our prioritization of Indigenous inclusion and the legacy commitment that we make through major event hosting,\u201d Clovechok wrote. Players react to possibility Regina Pats centre Connor Bedard played in the COVID-shortened 2022 tournament in Alberta. The 16-year-old product of North Vancouver, B.C., would love to see the 2023 tournament in his adopted backyard. \u201cAnywhere you play in Canada, you watch those tournaments growing up and it\u2019s crazy, the support Team Canada gets,\u201d he said Wednesday. \u201cEven us (at the tournament in Edmonton), it was 50 per cent capacity but everyone\u2019s face (was) painted and that sort of thing. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a pretty cool atmosphere and if we can get it here, I\u2019m sure it\u2019d be pretty crazy.\u201d Saskatoon Blades forward Tristen Robins agreed, noting Saskatchewan\u2019s \u201ca good hockey province.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019d be awesome,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019d get a lot of interest for sure. A lot of people that maybe don\u2019t normally come to a lot of games, they\u2019ll come out and watch those and enjoy their time.\u201d Bedard played in the 2022 tournament and he likely will be invited to play for Canada when the \u201922 event is contested again in August. If he makes Team Canada for the 2023 tournament, he would be playing in his third world juniors in one calendar year. \u201cThat\u2019s probably not going to happen again, so it\u2019s definitely pretty cool (after) growing up watching it and having that dream of always playing in that tournament,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously we got a couple of games in in December and just the support you feel from the country and everyone in the building is so cool. If (playing three in one year) is able to happen, that would be something very special.\u201d \u2014 With files from 980 CJME\u2019s Britton Gray",

            "content": "When Dove Cameron started writing \u201cBoyfriend,\u201d she had zero expectations it would take flight. \u201cI never thought it would end up on the EP if I\u2019m being honest,\u201d she tells Billboard. But after a TikTok tease of the chorus went viral, the singer/actress and her team wasted no time getting into the studio to complete the unfinished demo. Now, the Disruptor Records single is her first non-Disney hit on the Billboard Hot 100, reaching No. 42 on the March 19, 2022 tally. \u201cUsually you have three months to prepare for a song, but we all strapped in and have been making up for lost time. Which means I\u2019m not ever sleeping,\u201d she laughs. \u201cBoyfriend\u201d is not only a win for the Descendants/Liv and Maddie alum\u2019s adult music career, but a validation of her queer identity, which the public only learned about last year (though she\u2019s been out to her friends and family since she was a child). \u201cThat means the most to me of anything,\u201d she shares. \u201cIt\u2019s healing for me to be having this experience.\u201d I will ask you about music, but first and foremost I have to know what it was like being a guest judge on Drag Race. It\u2019s one of those things that has meant so much to me for so long. And I was not fully convinced would ever happen. When they called, I had a full-blown panic attack \u2014 I\u2019ve been watching Drag Race for probably eight years. Seeing it so boldly represented in mainstream media was very important for my experience with my own coming out and my relationship with my queerness. How did \u201cBoyfriend\u201d come together? \u201cBoyfriend\u201d was the very first song I sat down to write for my EP. I had just come off a tour the night before, so I was writing from a perspective of freedom. I never thought it would end up on the EP, if I\u2019m being honest. I was telling the story of this crazy night I had a couple weeks before that. And in the middle of recounting this insane story I think I casually said something to the room like, \u201cF\u2013k, I could be a better boyfriend than this guy.\u201d And we were all kinda like, \u201cwait, is this a good hook?\u201d A lot of it became a report of what it felt like to grow up queer and be surrounded by all these women who were famously mistreated and under-celebrated. Can you share the particulars of that crazy night? The circumstances surrounding it were so far-fetched that if I told them to you it would give the whole thing away and it would reveal who these people are. I sadly can\u2019t. Just know it was a very wild night and maybe I\u2019ll put it into a book one day. How quickly did it come together? I\u2019m finding that of all my favorite songs I\u2019ve written myself, the concept, the writing process and the recording process are all under 3-4 hours, which sounds insane. It\u2019s fast. Once you have the concept and have built the world, that\u2019s the key for me at least. I\u2019ve fledged out a cinematic moment: we\u2019re gonna zoom-in on special shots, we\u2019re gonna get the atmosphere, it\u2019s gonna be lyrically aligned with making you feel transported somewhere. And once you do that, it\u2019s pretty easy. You\u2019re teeing up a scene that you yourself have roots in. I like writing from a sensory perspective. And the funny part, for me, is I had just come off of tour and my voice was wrecked. And everybody is like \u201cwow you have this saucy, sexy vocal sound\u201d and I\u2019m like, \u201cYou mean damage? It\u2019s called something is sitting on my cord.\u201d I\u2019m hearing a lot of cinematic terms as you describe your music. Do you draw on your acting as you record? Yes, definitely. When I set out to do the EP I was feeling particularly inspired by a lot of my male cinematic classic villains in some of my favorite films. Not their story, but the mood. Everything is very influenced by cinema for me. And \u201cBoyfriend\u201d is very orchestral, the big crashes and swells and the horns in the production. When \u201cBoyfriend\u201d blew up on TikTok, were you following all the clips people shared? What happened with \u201cBoyfriend\u201d is that I posted a nine-second clip of the chorus, which is really misleading \u2014 the rest of the song sounds nothing like the chorus. When it blew up I was so shocked. I was dumbfounded, jaw on the floor, refreshing the recreates every hour. Like, \u201cwhat is going on?\u201d It was like somebody put a spell on the song. I couldn\u2019t tear myself away from how creative people were getting. The mark of a song that is beloved is when people take it and make it into something else that\u2019s important to them. It\u2019s so flattering. TikTok is a great measure. Going forward I have a new song called \u201cBreakfast\u201d and I\u2019m going to test how people feel about the hook in \u201cBreakfast\u201d first before I decide what I\u2019m going to release next. It\u2019s an amazing immediate feedback loop we\u2019ve never had in the industry and it\u2019s going to allow me and other artists to release music more immediately. It\u2019s like, \u201cI wrote this last week and I\u2019m going to release it next week.\u201d It\u2019s really freeing. When it blew up, did your label notice and hop into gear? I\u2019ve been with the same team for ages. Everybody has kids, they\u2019re going to barbeques, they have migraines \u2013 it\u2019s just a bunch of humans. When I wrote \u201cBoyfriend\u201d and a bunch of other songs in October they were like, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you put something on TikTok to show fans that you\u2019re working on in the studio?\u201d And that was the whole reason I released \u201cBoyfriend.\u201d It was not a grand plan, there was no promo behind it. You tip to your queer identity in this song. It must have been liberating to see it received so well. Yes, for a million reasons. I can recognize that it looks so intentional, like I was like, \u201cNow I\u2019m gonna dye my hair and write a queer anthem,\u201d but that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. I wrote it being like, \u201cI don\u2019t even know if this is good\u201d and then put it away and wrote a bunch of other songs where my sexuality isn\u2019t the focal point. And then when people warmly responded to the hook I was like, \u201coh they think it\u2019s something it\u2019s not, it\u2019s going to be disappointing (for them).\u201d But then to watch the rollout and see people continue to beat the support drum \u2013 \u201coh we love it, no questions\u201d \u2014 has been very healing for me. Both to marry who I\u2019ve always known myself to be with my very public decade-long career; those things have been very separate. To be clear, I\u2019ve always known who I was and always been out in my own immediate circles. I feel very lucky. I think I told my parents I was queer when I was eight. I told them, \u201cI\u2019m in love with Erin. And also Colby.\u201d And they were like, \u201cGreat.\u201d It was unbelievably lucky. When I went into a career in the public eye, it wasn\u2019t like, \u201cI\u2019m going to keep this a secret.\u201d It was like, \u201cI know I\u2019m queer and someone will probably ask me about it and then I\u2019ll say it.\u201d But no one ever did! And I was publicly dating men and I think I present like a straight cis woman, no one asked me. So finally when it came up and I was like \u201cI\u2019m really f\u2014ing gay,\u201d people were like \u201cw-w-wait, wha?!\u201d For the most part, people are very kind and very receptive, and I think that\u2019s a testament to where we are right now with this younger generation and their own queer experiences. This generation is so much more expressive and in touch and in communication with each other about intentionally building queer circles and opening up the conversation. It\u2019s a much more open-minded generation from when even I was in middle school. That means the most to me of anything. Does the rest of the EP sound like this or are there some left turns? All the music coming next is sonically from the same world. We use a lot of organic sixties musicality, a lot of jazz. In the way that \u201cBoyfriend\u201d is secretly a jazz song \u2013 we snuck in an upright bass. They all live within the same world but they are all different girls. What is it gonna be like on stage when you tour? I\u2019m still figuring that out, but if I was to dream it up, I told my label I want lots of horns and strings and they were like \u201cGreat.\u201d When I tour, I was presenting more rock/alternative before and now I\u2019m thinking big band/jazz. I\u2019m very excited for all the live shows. I found this incredibly talented upright bassist and cellist and violinist and all this crazy sh-t. This is my dream as a movie villain myself \u2013 I\u2019m already walking around the world thinking there are strings and horns behind me. It\u2019s a blend of sexy film noir but it\u2019s modern. The blueprint of the house is a dubstep song, drrrrrr, then huge drop, but we\u2019re doing it with live instrumentation and with a sexy affectation. I thought you said Dovestep for a moment. You\u2019re not the first person to say that. How f\u2013king egotistical would that be? \u201cI\u2019m creating my own genre and you\u2019re going to have to get with it.\u201d Anything else you want to add? I want to thank everybody. I\u2019ve never felt this creatively in touch and permitted to create whatever I want. I think I told myself I was always a supporter for whatever other people wanted to do, and suddenly I just feel renewed and inspired. This song has changed my life and people\u2019s reaction to it has changed my life. I\u2019m shocked and grateful and want to say thank you.",

But after a TikTok tease of the chorus went viral, the singer/actress and her team wasted no time getting into the studio to complete the unfinished demo. See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news Now, the Disruptor Records single is her first non-Disney hit on the Billboard Hot 100, reaching No. 42 on the March 19, 2022 tally. \u201cUsually you have three months to prepare for a song, but we all strapped in and have been making up for lost time. Which means I\u2019m not ever sleeping,\u201d she laughs. \u201cBoyfriend\u201d is not only a win for the Descendants/Liv and Maddie alum\u2019s adult music career, but a validation of her queer identity, which the public only learned about last year (though she\u2019s been out to her friends and family since she was a child). \u201cThat means the most to me of anything,\u201d she shares. \u201cIt\u2019s healing for me to be having this experience.\u201d I will ask you about music, but first and foremost I have to know what it was like being a guest judge on Drag Race . It\u2019s one of those things that has meant so much to me for so long. And I was not fully convinced would ever happen. When they called, I had a full-blown panic attack \u2014 I\u2019ve been watching Drag Race for probably eight years. Seeing it so boldly represented in mainstream media was very important for my experience with my own coming out and my relationship with my queerness. How did \u201cBoyfriend\u201d come together? \u201cBoyfriend\u201d was the very first song I sat down to write for my EP. I had just come off a tour the night before, so I was writing from a perspective of freedom. I never thought it would end up on the EP, if I\u2019m being honest. I was telling the story of this crazy night I had a couple weeks before that. And in the middle of recounting this insane story I think I casually said something to the room like, \u201cF\u2013k, I could be a better boyfriend than this guy.\u201d And we were all kinda like, \u201cwait, is this a good hook?\u201d A lot of it became a report of what it felt like to grow up queer and be surrounded by all these women who were famously mistreated and under-celebrated. Can you share the particulars of that crazy night? The circumstances surrounding it were so far-fetched that if I told them to you it would give the whole thing away and it would reveal who these people are. I sadly can\u2019t. Just know it was a very wild night and maybe I\u2019ll put it into a book one day. How quickly did it come together? I\u2019m finding that of all my favorite songs I\u2019ve written myself, the concept, the writing process and the recording process are all under 3-4 hours, which sounds insane. It\u2019s fast. Once you have the concept and have built the world, that\u2019s the key for me at least. I\u2019ve fledged out a cinematic moment: we\u2019re gonna zoom-in on special shots, we\u2019re gonna get the atmosphere, it\u2019s gonna be lyrically aligned with making you feel transported somewhere. And once you do that, it\u2019s pretty easy. You\u2019re teeing up a scene that you yourself have roots in. I like writing from a sensory perspective. And the funny part, for me, is I had just come off of tour and my voice was wrecked. And everybody is like \u201cwow you have this saucy, sexy vocal sound\u201d and I\u2019m like, \u201cYou mean damage? It\u2019s called something is sitting on my cord.\u201d I\u2019m hearing a lot of cinematic terms as you describe your music. Do you draw on your acting as you record? Yes, definitely. When I set out to do the EP I was feeling particularly inspired by a lot of my male cinematic classic villains in some of my favorite films. Not their story, but the mood. Everything is very influenced by cinema for me. And \u201cBoyfriend\u201d is very orchestral, the big crashes and swells and the horns in the production. When \u201cBoyfriend\u201d blew up on TikTok, were you following all the clips people shared? What happened with \u201cBoyfriend\u201d is that I posted a nine-second clip of the chorus, which is really misleading \u2014 the rest of the song sounds nothing like the chorus. When it blew up I was so shocked. I was dumbfounded, jaw on the floor, refreshing the recreates every hour. Like, \u201cwhat is going on?\u201d It was like somebody put a spell on the song. I couldn\u2019t tear myself away from how creative people were getting. The mark of a song that is beloved is when people take it and make it into something else that\u2019s important to them. It\u2019s so flattering. TikTok is a great measure. Going forward I have a new song called \u201cBreakfast\u201d and I\u2019m going to test how people feel about the hook in \u201cBreakfast\u201d first before I decide what I\u2019m going to release next. It\u2019s an amazing immediate feedback loop we\u2019ve never had in the industry and it\u2019s going to allow me and other artists to release music more immediately. It\u2019s like, \u201cI wrote this last week and I\u2019m going to release it next week.\u201d It\u2019s really freeing. When it blew up, did your label notice and hop into gear? I\u2019ve been with the same team for ages. Everybody has kids, they\u2019re going to barbeques, they have migraines \u2013 it\u2019s just a bunch of humans. When I wrote \u201cBoyfriend\u201d and a bunch of other songs in October they were like, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you put something on TikTok to show fans that you\u2019re working on in the studio?\u201d And that was the whole reason I released \u201cBoyfriend.\u201d It was not a grand plan, there was no promo behind it. You tip to your queer identity in this song. It must have been liberating to see it received so well. Yes, for a million reasons.

One of the things it\u2019s looking for is methane, a chemical compound that can indicate the presence of life. Methane is a compelling biosignature. Finding a large amount of methane in an exoplanet\u2019s atmosphere might be our most reliable indication that life\u2019s at work there. There are abiotic sources of methane, but for the most part, methane comes from life. But to understand methane as a potential biosignature, we need to understand it in a planetary context. A new research letter aims to do that. Methane is interesting because it doesn\u2019t last long in an atmosphere. Photochemical reactions destroy it, so detecting a lot of it means something is constantly replenishing it. There has to be a large and prominent source. \u201cTerrestrial planets, which are the focus of this study, require significant methane surface fluxes to sustain high atmospheric abundances,\u201d the study says. \u201cOn Earth, life sustains large methane surface fluxes, and so methane has long been regarded as a potential biosignature gas for terrestrial exoplanets.\u201d But not all methane detections will mean life. Scientists need a way to work through any future methane detections in exoplanet atmospheres. The researchers wanted to create a \u201c\u2026dedicated assessment of the planetary conditions needed for methane to be a good biosignature.\u201d \u201cWe wanted to provide a framework for interpreting observations, so if we see a rocky planet with methane, we know what other observations are needed for it to be a persuasive biosignature.\u201d Maggie Thompson, lead author, UC Santa Cruz. The new research letter is titled \u201cThe case and context for atmospheric methane as an exoplanet biosignature.\u201d It\u2019s available online at the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS.) The lead author is Maggie Thompson, a graduate student in astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. Part of methane\u2019s status as a reliable biosignature is its detectability. Oxygen is a good biosignature, and for some of the same reasons methane is. Like methane, it\u2019s also unstable in an atmosphere, so finding a large quantity of it means a significant source is replenishing it. The James Webb Space Telescope will be operating soon, and one of its jobs is to examine exoplanet atmospheres spectroscopically. It\u2019ll be characterizing exoplanet atmospheres, and detecting biosignatures is part of that work. But while Webb will detect methane relatively easily in a terrestrial atmosphere, oxygen is more difficult to detect. \u201cGiven the imminent feasibility of observing methane with JWST, it is imperative to determine the planetary conditions where methane is a compelling biosignature,\u201d the authors write. This research letter wants to put scientists in a stronger position to interpret methane\u2019s presence in an exoplanet atmosphere. The idea is to identify what other questions researchers need to ask when they detect methane. What other indications will support the conclusion that methane is a biosignature? What will contradict that? \u201cWe wanted to provide a framework for interpreting observations, so if we see a rocky planet with methane, we know what other observations are needed for it to be a persuasive biosignature,\u201d lead author Thompson said in a press release. The team examined abiotic methane sources to understand how they might account for methane in an exoplanet atmosphere. Volcanoes are one abiotic source of methane. Methane also comes from reactions in places like mid-ocean ridges, hydrothermal vents, and tectonic subduction zones. Comet and asteroid impacts can also produce methane. Researchers can look for evidence of these sources on an exoplanet where they detect methane. <Click Image to Enlarge> This figure from the study compares methane sources on Earth. The top row shows biogenic methane flux; all other rows show abiogenic methane flux from other sources. No abiotic source can produce the same methane flux as life can. Image Credit: Thompson et al. 2022. In planetary atmospheres, methane exists in relation to other gases. So identifying abiotic methane sources is only part of the picture. How do other gases like carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide fit into a methane-rich atmosphere? How do they affect one another? \u201cMethane is one piece of the puzzle, but to determine if there is life on a planet you have to consider its geochemistry, how it\u2019s interacting with its star and the many processes that can affect a planet\u2019s atmosphere on geologic timescales.\u201dMaggie Thompson, lead author, UC Santa Cruz. From the research letter: \u201cWhile methane can be produced by a variety of abiotic mechanisms such as outgassing, serpentinizing reactions, and impacts, we argue that\u2014in contrast to an Earth-like biosphere\u2014known abiotic processes cannot easily generate atmospheres rich in CH4 and CO2 with limited CO\u2026\u201d the authors explain in their paper. Earth\u2019s history provides some clues to methane in exoplanet atmospheres. We know that in the past, Earth had an even more methane-rich atmosphere than it does now. And we know what the source was: life. \u201cIf you detect a lot of methane on a rocky planet, you typically need a massive source to explain that,\u201d said co-author Joshua Krissansen-Totton, a Sagan Fellow at UCSC. \u201cWe know biological activity creates large amounts of methane on Earth, and probably did on the early Earth as well because making methane is a fairly easy thing to do metabolically.\u201d Methane-producing microorganisms called methanogens were one of Earth\u2019s earliest lifeforms, originating between 4.11 and 3.78 billion years ago. They were so effective at producing methane that at several times early Earth likely had a hazy, methane-filled atmosphere similar to Saturn\u2019s moon Titan. Maybe we\u2019ll find an exoplanet with a methane-rich atmosphere similar to early Earth\u2019s one day. If that happens, we\u2019ll likely detect it from a great distance, making it challenging to determine if the source is biotic. But detecting abiotic sources of methane is potentially much more straightforward. Volcanoes, for example, provide other clues that methane is from a non-living source. Volcanoes not only inject methane into the atmosphere but also carbon monoxide. On the other hand, biological activity is likely to consume carbon monoxide. The researchers found that nonbiological processes cannot readily produce habitable planet atmospheres rich in methane and carbon dioxide and with little to no carbon monoxide. This diagram shows the geological process of subduction, where a heavier tectonic plate sinks under a lighter one. Alteration of ultramafic rocks in subduction zones plays a major role in methane production via abiotic processes on Earth and beyond.

They found that detecting methane is a strong indicator of life for a rocky planet orbiting a Sun-like star if the atmosphere also contains carbon dioxide. If methane is more abundant than carbon dioxide, that\u2019s also a more robust indicator of life, as long as the planet isn\u2019t too water-rich. This image is a summary of known abiotic sources of methane on Earth. (\u00a92022 Elena Hartley) The James Webb Space Telescope is extraordinarily powerful. But no observing tool or method is error-free, even the long-awaited Webb. False positives are an issue in scientific endeavours like the search for biosignatures. The researchers looked at the role false positives play in biosignatures and gave some guidelines for handling methane detections. \u201cThe atmospheres of rocky exoplanets are probably going to surprise us, and we will need to be cautious in our interpretations.\u201dJoshua Krissansen-Totton, co-author, UCSC. \u201cThere are two things that could go wrong\u2014you could misinterpret something as a biosignature and get a false positive, or you could overlook something that\u2019s a real biosignature,\u201d Krissansen-Totton said. \u201cWith this paper, we wanted to develop a framework to help avoid both of those potential errors with methane.\u201d \u201cWith the upcoming technological advancements in exoplanet observations enabling the characterization of potentially habitable exoplanets, it is important to consider possible biosignature gases and the sources of false-positive detections,\u201d the research letter says. \u201cThis is particularly urgent for methane since biogenic methane is likely detectable for some terrestrial exoplanets with JWST.\u201d The researchers acknowledge that various abiotic sources could replenish atmospheric methane in diverse planetary environments. But for a planet to produce a methane flux comparable to Earth\u2019s, the same abiotic sources would also generate \u201cobservable contextual clues\u201d that would indicate a false positive. \u201cIn every case, abiotic processes cannot easily produce atmospheres rich in CH4 and CO2 with negligible CO\u2026\u201d Life would readily consume the CO. \u201cClearly, the mere detection of methane in an exoplanet\u2019s atmosphere is not sufficient evidence to indicate the presence of life given the variety of abiotic methane-production mechanisms. Instead, the entire planetary and astrophysical context must be taken into account to interpret atmospheric methane.\u201d The hunt for biosignatures in exoplanet atmospheres is a relatively new scientific undertaking. Researchers need to do a lot of groundwork before they can have confidence in detecting things like methane. The recent detection, or non-detection, of methane on Mars, shows how incomplete our understanding of other planets is and how the detection of methane may only be a starting point in painting a complete picture of a planet. This image illustrates possible ways methane might get into Mars\u2019 atmosphere and be removed from it: microbes (left) under the surface that release the gas into the atmosphere, weathering of rock (right), and stored methane ice called a clathrate. Ultraviolet light can work on surface materials to produce methane and break it apart into other molecules (formaldehyde and methanol) to produce carbon dioxide. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/SAM-GSFC/Univ. of Michigan \u201cThis study is focused on the most obvious false positives for methane as a biosignature,\u201d Krissansen-Totton said. \u201cThe atmospheres of rocky exoplanets are probably going to surprise us, and we will need to be cautious in our interpretations. Future work should try to anticipate and quantify more unusual mechanisms for nonbiological methane production.\u201d \u201cWith these results, we provide a tentative framework for assessing methane biosignatures,\u201d the authors write. \u201cIf life is abundant in the Universe, then with the correct planetary context, atmospheric methane may be the first detectable indication of life beyond Earth.\u201d More: Press Release: Methane could be the first detectable indication of life beyond EarthResearch Letter: The case and context for atmospheric methane as an exoplanet biosignatureUniverse Today: If a Planet Has a Lot of Methane in its Atmosphere, Life is the Most Likely Cause The post It\u2019s Not Conclusive, But Methane is Probably the Best Sign of Life on Exoplanets appeared first on Universe Today.",

A new research letter aims to do that. Methane is interesting because it doesn\u2019t last long in an atmosphere. Photochemical reactions destroy it, so detecting a lot of it means something is constantly replenishing it. There has to be a large and prominent source. \u201cTerrestrial planets, which are the focus of this study, require significant methane surface fluxes to sustain high atmospheric abundances,\u201d the study says. \u201cOn Earth, life sustains large methane surface fluxes, and so methane has long been regarded as a potential biosignature gas for terrestrial exoplanets.\u201d But not all methane detections will mean life. Scientists need a way to work through any future methane detections in exoplanet atmospheres. The researchers wanted to create a \u201c\u2026dedicated assessment of the planetary conditions needed for methane to be a good biosignature.\u201d \u201cWe wanted to provide a framework for interpreting observations, so if we see a rocky planet with methane, we know what other observations are needed for it to be a persuasive biosignature.\u201d The new research letter is titled \u201c The case and context for atmospheric methane as an exoplanet biosignature. \u201d It\u2019s available online at the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS.) The lead author is Maggie Thompson, a graduate student in astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. Part of methane\u2019s status as a reliable biosignature is its detectability. Oxygen is a good biosignature, and for some of the same reasons methane is. Like methane, it\u2019s also unstable in an atmosphere, so finding a large quantity of it means a significant source is replenishing it. The James Webb Space Telescope will be operating soon, and one of its jobs is to examine exoplanet atmospheres spectroscopically. It\u2019ll be characterizing exoplanet atmospheres, and detecting biosignatures is part of that work. But while Webb will detect methane relatively easily in a terrestrial atmosphere, oxygen is more difficult to detect. \u201cGiven the imminent feasibility of observing methane with JWST, it is imperative to determine the planetary conditions where methane is a compelling biosignature,\u201d the authors write. This research letter wants to put scientists in a stronger position to interpret methane\u2019s presence in an exoplanet atmosphere. The idea is to identify what other questions researchers need to ask when they detect methane. What other indications will support the conclusion that methane is a biosignature? What will contradict that? \u201cWe wanted to provide a framework for interpreting observations, so if we see a rocky planet with methane, we know what other observations are needed for it to be a persuasive biosignature,\u201d lead author Thompson said in a press release. The team examined abiotic methane sources to understand how they might account for methane in an exoplanet atmosphere. Volcanoes are one abiotic source of methane. Methane also comes from reactions in places like mid-ocean ridges, hydrothermal vents, and tectonic subduction zones. Comet and asteroid impacts can also produce methane. Researchers can look for evidence of these sources on an exoplanet where they detect methane. In planetary atmospheres, methane exists in relation to other gases. So identifying abiotic methane sources is only part of the picture. How do other gases like carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide fit into a methane-rich atmosphere? How do they affect one another? \u201cMethane is one piece of the puzzle, but to determine if there is life on a planet you have to consider its geochemistry, how it\u2019s interacting with its star and the many processes that can affect a planet\u2019s atmosphere on geologic timescales.\u201d From the research letter: \u201cWhile methane can be produced by a variety of abiotic mechanisms such as outgassing, serpentinizing reactions, and impacts, we argue that\u2014in contrast to an Earth-like biosphere\u2014known abiotic processes cannot easily generate atmospheres rich in CH4 and CO2 with limited CO\u2026\u201d the authors explain in their paper. Earth\u2019s history provides some clues to methane in exoplanet atmospheres. We know that in the past, Earth had an even more methane-rich atmosphere than it does now. And we know what the source was: life. \u201cIf you detect a lot of methane on a rocky planet, you typically need a massive source to explain that,\u201d said co-author Joshua Krissansen-Totton, a Sagan Fellow at UCSC. \u201cWe know biological activity creates large amounts of methane on Earth, and probably did on the early Earth as well because making methane is a fairly easy thing to do metabolically.\u201d Methane-producing microorganisms called methanogens were one of Earth\u2019s earliest lifeforms, originating between 4.11 and 3.78 billion years ago. They were so effective at producing methane that at several times early Earth likely had a hazy, methane-filled atmosphere similar to Saturn\u2019s moon Titan. Maybe we\u2019ll find an exoplanet with a methane-rich atmosphere similar to early Earth\u2019s one day. If that happens, we\u2019ll likely detect it from a great distance, making it challenging to determine if the source is biotic. But detecting abiotic sources of methane is potentially much more straightforward. Volcanoes, for example, provide other clues that methane is from a non-living source. Volcanoes not only inject methane into the atmosphere but also carbon monoxide. On the other hand, biological activity is likely to consume carbon monoxide. The researchers found that nonbiological processes cannot readily produce habitable planet atmospheres rich in methane and carbon dioxide and with little to no carbon monoxide. \u201cOne molecule is not going to give you the answer\u2014you have to take into account the planet\u2019s full context,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cMethane is one piece of the puzzle, but to determine if there is life on a planet, you have to consider its geochemistry, how it\u2019s interacting with its star and the many processes that can affect a planet\u2019s atmosphere on geologic timescales.\u201d The authors point out that the detection of methane in an exoplanet\u2019s atmosphere is just the beginning. They found that detecting methane is a strong indicator of life for a rocky planet orbiting a Sun-like star if the atmosphere also contains carbon dioxide. If methane is more abundant than carbon dioxide, that\u2019s also a more robust indicator of life, as long as the planet isn\u2019t too water-rich. The James Webb Space Telescope is extraordinarily powerful. But no observing tool or method is error-free, even the long-awaited Webb. False positives are an issue in scientific endeavours like the search for biosignatures. The researchers looked at the role false positives play in biosignatures and gave some guidelines for handling methane detections. \u201cThe atmospheres of rocky exoplanets are probably going to surprise us, and we will need to be cautious in our interpretations.\u201d \u201cThere are two things that could go wrong\u2014you could misinterpret something as a biosignature and get a false positive, or you could overlook something that\u2019s a real biosignature,\u201d Krissansen-Totton said. \u201cWith this paper, we wanted to develop a framework to help avoid both of those potential errors with methane.\u201d \u201cWith the upcoming technological advancements in exoplanet observations enabling the characterization of potentially habitable exoplanets, it is important to consider possible biosignature gases and the sources of false-positive detections,\u201d the research letter says. \u201cThis is particularly urgent for methane since biogenic methane is likely detectable for some terrestrial exoplanets with JWST.\u201d The researchers acknowledge that various abiotic sources could replenish atmospheric methane in diverse planetary environments. But for a planet to produce a methane flux comparable to Earth\u2019s, the same abiotic sources would also generate \u201cobservable contextual clues\u201d that would indicate a false positive. \u201cIn every case, abiotic processes cannot easily produce atmospheres rich in CH4 and CO2 with negligible CO\u2026\u201d Life would readily consume the CO. \u201cClearly, the mere detection of methane in an exoplanet\u2019s atmosphere is not sufficient evidence to indicate the presence of life given the variety of abiotic methane-production mechanisms. Instead, the entire planetary and astrophysical context must be taken into account to interpret atmospheric methane.\u201d The hunt for biosignatures in exoplanet atmospheres is a relatively new scientific undertaking. Researchers need to do a lot of groundwork before they can have confidence in detecting things like methane. The recent detection, or non-detection, of methane on Mars, shows how incomplete our understanding of other planets is and how the detection of methane may only be a starting point in painting a complete picture of a planet. \u201cThis study is focused on the most obvious false positives for methane as a biosignature,\u201d Krissansen-Totton said. \u201cThe atmospheres of rocky exoplanets are probably going to surprise us, and we will need to be cautious in our interpretations. Future work should try to anticipate and quantify more unusual mechanisms for nonbiological methane production.\u201d \u201cWith these results, we provide a tentative framework for assessing methane biosignatures,\u201d the authors write. \u201cIf life is abundant in the Universe, then with the correct planetary context, atmospheric methane may be the first detectable indication of life beyond Earth.\u201d",

Late last year, during the \u201cSwinging With The Stars\u201d event, Danielle Carter, owner of 4 Horsemen Fitness was given an idea after she was asked why she didn\u2019t have any challenges for men at her gym. \u201cI went home that night, and I was thinking, \u2018you know what? I don\u2019t.\u2019 I train tons of youth, I train tons of women, but I don\u2019t really do a challenge for the guys.\u201d She would later create the \u201cDad Bod Challenge\u201d which started in January and will wrap up on Sunday. About 20 men signed for the challenge which involved more than just hitting the gym once in a while. \u201cAll about how to clean eat, how to build exercise if it\u2019s either at the 4 Horsemen or at their homes. How they can manage stress, eat better, kind of live a more healthy, wellness life.\u201d In the past few months, Carter said it has been a rousing success. \u201cI\u2019ve had people that had to lose like 50, 60 pounds. I\u2019ve had people that really didn\u2019t have to lose a lot of weight but were having back pain and leg pain. Just getting everybody to get off the couch and just to do something that\u2019s more mentally and physically better for them. I\u2019ve even had people say it has changed their household, their family unit\u2019s better, they have more energy.\u201d Local businessmen Brent MacDonald and Regan Grimwood were just two of the participants in the challenge. \u201cI\u2019m 59 years old and I started reviewing my weight and I always thought that I was in good shape and this challenge came along and I think the only way that ever worked for me to do any dieting and workout is to have a challenge,\u201d said MacDonald. Grimwood said he signed up for the challenge after he and his business partner met Carter at a Raiders game and were excited about the opportunity. \u201cWe basically committed that night and we haven\u2019t looked back,\u201d Grimwood said. Both Grimwood and MacDonald said despite the challenge ending soon, they plan to keep going. \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s very good for the future and the positive place of 4 Horsemen Fitness and Danielle and the coaches, it\u2019s just a wonderful, happy atmosphere.\u201d \u201cYou look forward to it every day. You\u2019d hate to go this far and give up now,\u201d added Grimwood. \u201cI would highly recommend it to anyone else that\u2019s looking to change their lifestyle as far as diet and exercise. It\u2019s definitely changed my lifestyle.\u201d Carter said by the time the challenge wraps up on Sunday, they\u2019ll be close to 350 pounds lost among the group. \u2014 derek.craddock@pattisonmedia.com On Twitter: @pa_craddock",

The U.S. men\u2019s national team entered the final game of World Cup qualifying in prime position to punch its ticket to Qatar. After Sunday\u2019s 5\u20131 win over Panama at home, the U.S. was assured of qualifying for the November tournament as long as it didn\u2019t lose last night\u2019s game in Costa Rica by six or more goals. As unlikely as a blowout that massive would be, memories of the Americans\u2019 epic last-day collapse against Trinidad and Tobago in 2017 and their overall qualifying record in Costa Rica (0-9-2) were enough to make fans just a little bit nervous. The U.S. did lose, but the score was only 2\u20130, thus securing its spot in the field in Qatar. The defeat made celebrating feel strange for the players at first. \u201cI think it took me a little bit for it to sink in,\u201d Christian Pulisic said. \u201cOnce we got back in the locker room and just seeing all the guys, I think we\u2019re allowed to be happy and proud that we\u2019re qualified for a World Cup\u2014because this process is not easy.\u201dAs for the game itself, Brian Straus was in San Jos\u00e9 and wrote that the lively atmosphere in the Estadio Nacional helped propel Los Ticos to victory:\u201cAlthough the Americans dominated early, they couldn\u2019t solve Navas. Costa Rica grew into the game and a poor 10-minute stretch midway through the second half sealed the U.S.\u2019s very short-term fate. Costa Rica defender Juan Pablo Vargas and striker Anthony Contreras did the damage.\u201dThe U.S. joins a list of 29 teams that have qualified for the tournament. The last three spots will be determined by a series of playoff matchups in the coming months, one of which will include Costa Rica. But even with a few spots left to be secured, the draw for the tournament will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m. ET. Marcus Krum has an explanation of how the draw will work. The 2022 World Cup will run from Nov. 21 to Dec. 17 (because Qatar\u2019s climate makes the traditional summer schedule impractical), which means U.S. coach Greg Berhalter will spend the next few months closely monitoring his players\u2019 form as he prepares to select the squad that will get on the plane to the Middle East. A lot can happen between now and then, but Avi Creditor has an early projection for the USMNT roster.The best of Sports IllustratedForty years ago, Cheyney State University played in the first women\u2019s Final Four.

Chris Paul\u2019s floater to extend the Suns\u2019 lead to three (hence why Poole felt the need to pull up from half court)1. Miles Bridges\u2019s windmill dunkSIQWhich current Supreme Court justice (then a federal district judge) issued a ruling on this day in 1995 that effectively ended the MLB strike?Yesterday\u2019s SIQ: Which school had the second-longest Final Four streak, and how long was it?Answer: Ten years by the UCLA men\u2019s team from 1967 to \u201976. The Bruins reached 14 Final Fours and won 10 national championships from \u201962 to \u201980. UConn\u2019s dominance is even more amazing when you consider how different the tournament was during UCLA\u2019s run. The 1967 and \u201968 editions had only 23 teams, and from \u201969 to \u201974 there were 25 teams, so UCLA got a bye into the regional semifinals (the Sweet 16). For the last two years of the streak, there were 32 teams in the tournament, so UCLA had to win only three games to reach the Final Four. Compare that to the four wins needed to capture a regional championship under the current 68-team format. That isn\u2019t to say that UCLA\u2019s streak isn\u2019t incredibly impressive, but to be as successful as UConn has been during an era when even more schools are investing heavily in sports is a remarkable achievement.From the Vault: March 30, 1981 Rich Clarkson/Sports Illustrated Speaking of UCLA, Bruins star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (known at the time as Lew Alcindor) landed on the cover of the March 31, 1969, issue of SI after leading his team to its third straight NCAA championship. The Bruins lost just one game that season (by two points against USC in the final game before the NCAA tournament) and then breezed through the West Region to the Final Four in which they faced a stiff challenge from Drake. The Bulldogs, of course, didn\u2019t have anyone who could see eye-to-eye with the 7'2\" center. Drake coach Maury John assigned a 6'5\" forward named Al Williams to guard him, which SI\u2019s Joe Jares likened to \u201casking an elf to chop down a redwood with a fingernail file.\u201d But Williams wasn\u2019t alone:\u201cThe strategy worked. While Drake\u2019s fine guard, Willie McCarter, and a substitute guard, Gary Zeller, were doing most of their team\u2019s critical scoring, Dolph Pulliam led a defense that so harassed the Bruins they could not see Alcindor well enough to get the ball in to him.\u200b\u200b\u201dKareem wasn\u2019t totally neutralized, though. He still had 25 points and 21 rebounds. UCLA hung on to beat Drake, 85\u201382, and then cruised past Purdue in the title game, 92\u201372, in what was the final game of Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s college career. His dominance against the Boilermakers (37 points on 15-of-20 shooting and 20 rebounds) is even more remarkable when you consider that he wasn\u2019t allowed to dunk. The NCAA had outlawed the dunk two years earlier in a move that purportedly came in response to the big man\u2019s unstoppable offense. Abdul-Jabbar was also dealing with off-court distractions before the Final Four. According to a second article in that same issue of SI, by Curry Kirkpatrick, Abdul-Jabbar had been upset about an article that appeared in a Los Angeles magazine the week before the team headed to Louisville. \u201cWritten by a former official of the Black Students Union at UCLA, it was a misleading and damaging piece that portrayed Alcindor as a racist bent on separatism and dissatisfied with his school and country,\u201d Kirkpatrick wrote. \u201cAlcindor was greatly upset by all this and further disturbed over the use of colloquial phrases attributed to him. He felt he had been made to look foolish and illiterate.\u201dBut Kareem cleared the air with his teammates and in a televised interview. Then he put the issue behind him and led his team to victory.Check out more of SI\u2019s archives and historic images at vault.si.com.",

            "content": "Please Hold For over 45 minutes this morning, Blue Origin had to hold the launch of its latest rocket launch into the upper atmosphere. After the agonizing wait, the company put the countdown clock back on ten minutes, declaring the New Shepard craft \u201cgo for launch\u201d \u2014 while largely acting like nothing happened. Then, seven minutes into that countdown, another hold of about a minute was called. The company then finally retracted the rocket\u2019s holding arms at around 10 am EST, successfully launching the capsule to an altitude of over 60 miles \u2014 although, it\u2019s worth noting, still hundreds of miles short of being able to enter the Earth\u2019s orbit. Guessing Game Strikingly, the company didn\u2019t give an official explanation as to why the launch was being delayed, leaving its live audience of over 13,000 on YouTube \u2014 and the company\u2019s two commentators \u2014 guessing as well. After the launch, a Blue Origin spokesperson told Futurism that \u201cwe identified a telemetry issue with the booster that required extra time to evaluate and clear.\u201d While it\u2019s far from the first time a crewed rocket launch has faced a hold \u2014 in all fairness, 45 minutes isn\u2019t that long \u2014 the company\u2019s silence on what happened should give pause. The launch dubbed NS-20 had six anxiously waiting passengers on board, including CEO billionaires, entrepreneurs, and Blue Origin\u2019s chief architect Gary Lai. \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d star Pete Davidson was also meant to accompany them, but backed out last week for unknown reasons.

            "content": "Austin\u2019s success in the last decade as the so-called Live Music Capital of the World has come with a major drawback \u2013 the artists who call the city home have been the first ones priced out of the market. That paradigm might begin to change thanks to a non-profit group organized by Austin venue owners along the city\u2019s famed Red River Street. On March 18, members of the National Independent Venue Association flocked to one of those venues for a special happy hour toasting their survival and return to Austin after a two-year closure. Their host for the day, Empire Control Room owner and NIVA cofounder Stephen Sternschein and longtime colleague Cody Cowan, executive director of the Red River Cultural District, were on hand catching up with friends and discussing recent improvements to the area including sidewalk improvements, ADA ramp additions and some new landscaping and solar lighting. Cowan and Sternschein say momentum and public support for more ambitious projects to double the district\u2019s size (which now runs from Waterloo Park to the Austin Convention Center) has never been stronger. \u201cRed River Street is home to the highest concentration of touring venues in the country,\u201d says Cowan. Since the early 1990s the intersection of Sixth Street and Red River has served as the unofficial crossroads for South by Southwest, where the bars and restaurants of Sixth Street crossed paths with the venues of Red River. The intersection was home to Emo\u2019s, Austin\u2019s best rock club, and just a stone\u2019s throw from important music venues like Stubb\u2019s, Empire, Mohawk, the Chess Club, Valhalla and Cheer Up Charlies. \u201cThere thing people have always loved about Red River is that you could go out for the night and easily go to two or three different concerts,\u201d says Cowan, with venues ranging in capacity from a few dozen at Chess Club to 2,100 at Stubbs outdoor space. How Red River became the heavily trafficked home of a dozen venues is a historical fluke, Cowans notes \u2014 starting in the 1840s, for the first 100 years of its existence, it was Austin\u2019s only main road that wasn\u2019t uphill in either direction. Most of the clubs on the street started as post-WWII used furniture stores and antique shops, slowly transforming into a local entertainment destination in the 1970s that brought new visitors to Austin, along with new problems. The Austin Chronicle described Red River in a popular 1996 oral history as an \u201codd bird\u201d that had \u201cdone more to nurture original live music than Sixth Street or any other concentrated area in town.\u201d As the piece noted, it was also home to high concentrations of \u201chomeless people, winos, junkies, small-time criminals, and drug trafficking.\u201d Beginning in the mid-2000s, the greater Austin area was also experiencing a major population boom, growing 83%from 2000 to 2020 from 1.2 million to 2.3 million residents. Initially many newcomers were graduates of the city\u2019s University of Texas who decided to stay instead of returning to more conservative and energy-industry driven cities like Houston or Dallas. Young professionals from Los Angeles and New York were also moving to Austin, drawn to the promise of cheap real estate and no state income taxes. And former Govs. George W. Bush and Rick Perry actively courted private companies to relocate to the state with tax benefit programs like the 2002 Chapter 313 program, which amended part of the state\u2019s property tax code to discount local school taxes for corporations and, according to the Texas Tribune using numbers provided by state comptroller\u2019s office, resulted in $10.8 billion in tax savings for approximately 500 companies for energy companies and manufacturers including Samsung and Tesla. That population growth, averaging about 35% each decade, pushed real estate prices up and increased demand for commercial development. Music businesses that could not cover the rent left, while others were evicted when their lease expired to make way for more profitable businesses. \u201cA lot of the landlords began realizing they could make a lot more money renting a Chipotle and a Sprint store than to a music venue,\u201d says James Moody, owner of the Mohawk on the north end of Red River Street. As Austin became more expensive, its residents produced creative ways to push back, including the \u201cKeep Austin Weird\u201d campaign started by a local librarian in 2002. When that didn\u2019t work, Cowan said the Austin music scene doubled down on Gen X anti-commercial slacktivism and indifference, siloing off into a loosely connected federation of independently run venues. Red River doubled down on grime and cheap beers, Cowans said, \u201cbut eventually we realized we couldn\u2019t keep things shitty enough to stop global economics.\u201d Red River Street was prime downtown real estate and developers were eager to offer property owners cash for their lots. What followed was a rash of closures at venues like Badlands, The Saxon Pub, Red 7 and Austin Music Hall. Concerned about their future, venue owners who had never met or stepped inside their neighboring clubs launched a grassroots campaign in 2013 to lobby local and state officials for protection against gentrification. By 2015, venues like the Mohawk and Empire embraced the \u201cDefend Red River\u201d movement which led to the formation of the Red River Cultural District and a map of geographic boundaries of the district. Eventually a supportive City Council began developing policy and zoning restrictions in 2017 supporting the preservation and continued development of Austin\u2019s music scene. And then COVID-19 hit. On March 6, 2020, Austin officials canceled all live events right as the city was preparing to host what was expected to be the largest SXSW ever. \u201cWe make the bulk of our money for the year during those two weeks,\u201d said Moody who said he had more than $200,000 in Mohawk rental fees booked and was anticipating huge bar sales. All of it washed away as the state went into lockdown. Moody was forced to lay off his staff and began preparing for bankruptcy. A 2020 study by the Red River Cultural District estimate that Austin venues average about $40,000 in non-staff overhead each month. Moody joined other members of the cultural district in supporting the newly formed National Independent Venues Association, which successfully lobbied Congress for passage of a bill that raised $15 billion in emergency relief aid for venues in December 2020. Moody says he was also offered a once-in-a-lifetime bridge loan from a wealthy individual who kept the Mohawk afloat while he waited for federal funds to come in. Moody did not want to identify the generous supporter, but Billboard has independently confirmed that it was Austin real estate tycoon Gary Keller who stepped in to help, offering similar support to other Austin venues. (Keller has been doing this since 2016 when he bought out the landlord for the city\u2019s famed Saxon pub, preserving the singer-songwriter stage long celebrated for its finely tuned acoustics and family atmosphere.) Red River Street venues received $10 million of the $54 million that was granted to Austin venues through the SVOG, according to records from the Small Business Association, which manages the awards. Another $20 million was allocated to live music from local grants and state grants. \u201cVenues that have never had more than $15,000 in the bank now have half a million dollars in the bank in prepaid rent,\u201d says Moody. Now, he says, the back-to-back success staving off gentrification and the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant program has significantly increased the profile of the cultural district both in Austin and within the broader NIVA organization. Cowan tells Billboard he plans to tap into the goodwill the district has created by lobbying for the passage of a first-of-its-kind local hotel occupancy tax for commercial artists, an effort he started pursuing in 2019. In Texas, hotel occupancy taxes for the arts tend to go only to non-profit groups \u201clike the operas and ballets of the world,\u201d says Cowan, \u201cwhile live music gets boxed out because we\u2019re seen as roughshod, tattooed entertainment sector of the working-class.\u201d According to the Texas comptroller\u2019s office, non-profits like the cultural district can legally allocate hotel funds if the money is spent supporting individuals and organizations that bring visitors to the state. Cowan is lobbying city officials to set aside $3 million to both directly subsidize local musicians and reimburse venues that book local acts. Also on the agenda is a proposal to create a task force of Red River venue managers and residents to work closer with police to address issues of blight and vacancy that lead to crime in the area. \u201cThe district likes to really approach this in terms of placemaking,\u201d Cowan says. \u201cNature abhors a vacuum and crime tips to fill that gap for one reason or another.\u201d Working with public safety and public works, Cowan says his group has been mapping out crime and unsafe incidents and then addressing the problems through tools like infrastructure enhancements, pedestrian visibility, code enforcement and when needed, outside land development. \u201cWe want developers that can we partner with that will encourage sustainable growth that is compatible with our community,\u201d he says. The Red River Culture District is also working on efforts to provide equity pay for venue employees, diversity outreach to bring more groups into the live music community and national marketing and public relations campaigns based around Austin venues, artists and community members. In 2020, the Red River Cultural District was recognized by the Texas Commission on the Arts as one of 51 official cultural districts in the Lone Star State, allowing it to apply for cultural funding from the commission and market individual businesses with the district to a national audience. For Cowan that means creating national campaigns bases around the venues and cultural organizations he supports. The goal with many of these proposals, he says, is to influence other cities and arts- oriented groups to support similar initiatives aimed at protecting their cultural industries. \u201cThe touring world is an ecosystem that depends on everyone\u2019s survival,\u201d Cowan says. \u201cWhen one area fails, there\u2019s no stop gaps in place and everything begins to fall like dominoes. In order to survive you have to be able to ensure everyone else is healthy.\u201d",

            "full_description": "HELSINKI \u2014 China deorbited the Tianzhou-2 cargo spacecraft Thursday after testing on-orbit docking, refueling and module transposition for the Chinese space station. Tianzhou-2 reentered the atmosphere over the South Pacific at 6:40 a.m. Eastern March 31, China\u2019s human spaceflight agency, CMSA, announced minutes after the event. The area of the ocean is frequently used as a \u201cspacecraft cemetery.\u201d The spacecraft separated from the forward docking port of Tianhe, the core module of China\u2019s space station, at 3:59 a.m. Eastern March 27. Tianzhou-2 makes way for the arrival of the Tianzhou-4 cargo spacecraft which will provide fresh supplies and fuel ahead of the arrival of the Shenzhou-14 crew, with the latter expected to launch around mid-to-late May. The 10-month-long mission verified a number of technologies and procedures needed to proceed with future construction of the Chinese space station. Tianzhou-2 launched May 29, 2021, on a Long March 7 rocket from Wenchang. It completed automated rendezvous and docking maneuvers with Tianhe just over eight hours later. The 13.5-ton spacecraft was the first to join the Tianhe module in orbit, verifying on-orbit docking and refueling required for further missions to begin. It delivered 4.69 tons of cargo in a pressurized segment, including three months\u2019 worth of food for three Shenzhou-12 crew members and two EVA suits. It also carried 1.95 tons of propellant to the 22.5-ton Tianhe module, which had launched in late April. The spacecraft performed four rendezvous and docking maneuvers, including a manual remote operation rendezvous and docking, to test out procedures. Tianzhou-2 was also involved in a transposition test ahead of the arrival of two future modules, Wentian and Mengtian, due to launch later in the year. On Jan. 5 Tianhe\u2019s 10-meter-long robotic arm grasped Tianzhou-2, moving it roughly 20 degrees before returning it to the forward port on the Tianhe docking hub. Both new modules will dock with the forward port before being transposed to respective lateral docking ports, creating the finished \u201cT-shaped\u201d orbital outpost. China plans six missions in 2022 to complete its space station, including two cargo and two crewed missions along with the two module launches. The China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology (CALT) held a ceremony March 29 for launch teams that will be involved in the required Long March 2F, Long March 5B and Long March 7 rocket launches. The spacecraft for the ongoing Shenzhou-13 crewed mission is currently docked at the nadir port at Tianhe and is expected to depart in mid-April. Tianzhou-4 will launch for Tianhe following this, ahead of a new crew aboard Shenzhou-14. The 20-ton-plus Wentian and Mengtian modules will launch during the six-month-long Shenzhou-14 mission. Tianzhou-5 will launch ahead of Shenzhou-15, both scheduled for late in the year, with the latter expected to see the first Chinese crew handover aboard the completed space station. Tianzhou-5 will also carry five small satellite payloads among a range of experiments, CMSA announced March 30. The module launches will be followed closely, partly due to the significance of the missions, but also because of the use of the Long March 5B, the two previous launches of which saw the large first stages make high-profile uncontrolled reentries . The Tiangong space station is planned to operate in orbit for at least 10 years. It will host a range of international experiments through collaboration with the United Nations Office of Outer Space Affairs, and potentially foreign astronauts and further modules in the coming years.",

The flight will take place from Blue Origin\u2019s West Texas facility in Van Horn, with liftoff scheduled for Thursday, March 31 no earlier than 8:30 AM CDT (13:30 UTC). The NS-20 mission will utilize Blue Origin\u2019s fully reusable suborbital New Shepard launch system, designed to ferry payloads and people to just beyond the 100-kilometer K\u00e1rm\u00e1n Line \u2013 the conceptual international boundary between Earth\u2019s atmosphere and space \u2013 before returning them safely to the ground. The New Shepard capsule and booster have been reused for this mission, as was the case on all previous flights. This New Shepard flight will be the first for Blue Origin in 2022 and the second mission with a full crew complement since the NS-19 mission in December 2021. Other human spaceflight missions that utilized New Shepard only featured crews of four. This flight will also be the second human spaceflight mission launched in all of 2022 so far, coming behind the orbital Soyuz MS-21 mission to the International Space Station which launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on March 18. With the NS-20 mission, Blue Origin will bring its astronaut tally up to 20. The crew The six people who will fly on the NS-20 mission are: Gary Lai Lai is the Senior Director and Chief Architect of the New Shepard launch system and is responsible for next-generation designs, upgrades, and product developments for the New Shepard tourism business. Lai has had a storied career at Blue Origin since 2004, being one of the first 20 employees of the Washington-based company. His prior positions include Senior Director of System Engineering, System Architect, Crew Capsule Element Lead, and NASA Commercial Crew Development Program Manager as well as others. He has also been involved in product development and strategic planning for other Blue Origin products, including the New Glenn, Blue Moon, and rocket engine programs. On March 29, #NewShepard Chief Architect Gary Lai will fly on the vehicle he\u2019s spent 18 years designing, developing, testing, and flying.

His presence on the mission continues a tradition within Blue Origin of having an employee on board their flights in addition to paying customers; however, he was not an original member of the crew. Lai will fill a vacancy left by Saturday Night Live comedian and actor Pete Davidson, who was initially slated to launch with the other members of the NS-20 crew. The launch date was set for March 23 but was delayed initially to no earlier than March 29, after which it was announced that Davidson would no longer be able to fly.

Sharon and Marc Hagle The Hagles be the first married couple to fly to space on a commercial vehicle and the second married couple overall to travel to space together. The first married couple in space together were Jan Davis and Mark Lee who met when they were assigned to the same Space Shuttle mission. The pair married secretly shortly before the flight and only revealed their marriage when it was too late to remove either of them from the mission. They launched together on the shuttle Endeavour (STS-47) on September 12, 1992.

NS-20 crew member Dr. George Nield. (Credit: Blue Origin) The launch vehicle The New Shepard vehicle will transport the crew of the NS-20 mission to space and back down to Earth. The rocket is an 18-meter tall, single-stage suborbital booster. NS-20 will mark the 20th total flight for New Shepard since its debut in April 2015, with 16 uncrewed flights and three crewed missions under its belt to date. The New Shepard booster, known officially as the Propulsion Module, uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen as propellant and oxidizer, respectively, and is powered by a single BE-3PM engine that provides up to 490 kilonewtons (50 metric ton-force, or roughly 110,000 lbf) of thrust at liftoff. The BE-3PM runs on a tap-off combustion cycle, the first engine of this kind to see flight. The Crew Module sits atop the Propulsion Module and is designed to carry both pressurized cargo and/or people to an altitude exceeding 100 kilometers. It features an interior volume of 15 cubic meters and can seat up to six people. The Crew Module also features a launch abort system in the form of a solid rocket motor built by Aerojet Rocketdyne, only to be used in the event of an emergency before or during launch. This safety feature for New Shepard has been tested three times: once in a pad abort test in October 2012 and twice during separate in-flight abort tests in October 2016 and July 2018, respectively.

(Credit: Blue Origin) The Crew Module\u2019s large windows are designed to provide the best possible views for the crew during the flight. There are no manual controls for New Shepard, as all elements of the flight are controlled by the vehicle\u2019s onboard computers. Both key elements of the New Shepard launch system can be reused and reflown, with the Propulsion Module achieving a soft landing on a landing pad via retropropulsion and the Crew Module returning to Earth under parachute. The hardware elements expected to be used for the NS-20 mission are Propulsion Module Tail 4 and the RSS First Step Crew Module \u2014 the sixth flight for both elements. The flight Around three hours prior to launch, the New Shepard vehicle will be fueled and checked to ensure that all of the rocket\u2019s internal systems are functioning correctly. Crew ingress will take place approximately 45 minutes before liftoff. Given Blue Origin\u2019s countdown does not have built-in holds, it is customary to momentarily stop a New Shepard launch clock if the teams or crew are running slightly behind schedule \u2014 something that is not an issue for suborbital missions that do not have instantaneous rendezvous launch windows. In the final stages of the countdown, the access gantry will be retracted to clear New Shepard for liftoff, and gimbal checks for the engine and booster guide fins will take place \u2014 all set to occur within the final two minutes before launch. New Shepard lifts off from West Texas. (Credit: Jack Beyer for NSF) BE-3PM engine ignition will happen at T0, with liftoff following seven seconds afterward once health checks have been completed. At around T+55 seconds into the flight, New Shepard will pass through Max-Q \u2013 the region at which aerodynamic stresses on the vehicle are the greatest. Propulsion Module engine cutoff occurs at around the T+2 minute 20-second mark, with Crew Module separation following a few seconds later. Both elements of the vehicle will continue up to their independent apogees, with the crew able to experience between three to five minutes of microgravity. The Propulsion Module will then navigate down to the landing pad at Van Horn, using built-in guide vanes and drag brakes to control itself. The final descent will be performed using the thrust of the BE-3PM engine, with landing set to take place at around T+7 minutes and 30 seconds after liftoff. During landing, it is not uncommon for the Propulsion Module to come to a near-complete hover above the ground and translate a few meters in a given direction to properly align itself with the landing pad before easing itself the final few meters to the ground. The New Shepard Crew Module returns to Earth under parachute. (Credit: Blue Origin) Meanwhile, the Crew Module and its passengers will be undergoing their own return process. A set of drogue chutes will deploy first, slowing and stabilizing the capsule before the three main parachutes are unsheathed. The capsule will then float slowly down to the ground, using a small retro motor (different from the abort motor) to further slow itself in the final two seconds before touchdown. The total duration of the flight should be about 10 minutes for the crew. Once the Crew Module has landed, Blue Origin recovery crews will head to the landing site to begin the process of safing the capsule before crew extrication. The Propulsion Module and Crew Module will then be taken back and refurbished in advance of their next flight. (Lead image: The NS-20 crew observes their rocket and capsule.

According to U.S. astronomer Dr Tony Phillips, auroras could be visible as far south as New York and North Dakota. In the UK, skygazers in Scotland may catch a rare glimpse of the event, which appears when charged particles hit the atmosphere. \u201cA Cannibal CME hit Earth\u2019s magnetic field on March 31st (0210 UT),\u201d Dr Phillips wrote on his website spaceweather.com.

A total of 17 were captured by Nasa observatories exploding from the star on Monday and at least two were fired in Earth\u2019s direction. When CMEs reach Earth, they trigger what is known as a geomagnetic storm \u2013 a largely harmless disturbance of the magnetic field.

It said that geomagnetic storms of G3 (strong) and G2 (moderate) ratings were expected on Thursday and Friday respectively. In addition to triggering auroras, G3 storms can disrupt satellites and technology on Earth. These include intermittent problems with GPS, problems with high-frequency radio signals, and power system bugs, the NOAA said. It may sound ominous, but any issues caused by the storm will be minor and they are extremely unlikely to affect everyday life. Data on the CMEs has been captured by Nasa\u2019s Solar Dynamics Observatory and Solar and Heliospheric Observatory. Dr Phillips highlighted that the storms should lead to showings of the Northern Lights at unusually low latitudes. Writing on spaceweather.com, which tracks the sun\u2019s activity, he said that Americans should see them after nightfall on Wednesday. For Europeans, the hours before dawn on March 31 are favoured. \u201cWhen chasing auroras, dark skies are essential; go to the countryside,\u201d Dr Phillips wrote. \u201cUrban glare can overwhelm auroras even during a strong geomagnetic storm.\u201d Solar storms are caused by CMEs and solar flares, which are huge expulsions\u00a0of hot material called plasma from the Sun\u2019s outer layer. They can lead to the appearance of colourful auroras by energising particles in our planet\u2019s atmosphere Each solar storm is graded by severity on a scale of one to five, with a G1 described as \u201cminor\u201d and a G5 as \u201cextreme\u201d. At the upper end of the scale, storms wreak havoc on our planet\u2019s magnetic field, which can disrupt power grids and communications networks. \u201cHarmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth\u2019s atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground,\u201d Nasa says. \u201cHowever \u2013 when intense enough \u2013 they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where GPS and communications signals travel.\u201d Thankfully, this week\u2019s geomagnetic storms are unlikely to significantly impact life or technology on Earth. In the past, larger solar flares have wreaked havoc on our planet. In 1989, a strong solar eruption shot so many electrically charged particles at Earth that the Canadian Province of Quebec lost power for nine hours. As well as causing issues for our tech, they can cause harm to astronauts working on the International Space Station, either through radiation exposure or by interfering with mission control communications. The Earth\u2019s magnetic field helps to protect us from the more extreme consequences of solar flares.

The pair formed what's called a \"cannibal coronal mass ejection\" and careened toward us at 1.8MILLION mph (2.9m kph). They rattled our planet's magnetic field on Wednesday, triggering showings of the Northern Lights that are due to continue today. According to U.S. astronomer Dr Tony Phillips, auroras could be visible as far south as New York and North Dakota. In the UK, skygazers in Scotland may catch a rare glimpse of the event, which appears when charged particles hit the atmosphere. \"A Cannibal CME hit Earth's magnetic field on March 31st (0210 UT),\" Dr Phillips wrote on his website spaceweather.com . \"First contact sparked a G1-class geomagnetic storm with a chance of stronger storms later today as Earth passes through the CME's magnetized wake.\" The streams of hot material are the result of a frenzy of solar storms that erupted from the Sun this week. A total of 17 were captured by Nasa observatories exploding from the star on Monday and at least two were fired in Earth's direction. When CMEs reach Earth, they trigger what is known as a geomagnetic storm \u2013 a largely harmless disturbance of the magnetic field. On its space weather alert system , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration warned of possible effects on Earth. It said that geomagnetic storms of G3 (strong) and G2 (moderate) ratings were expected on Thursday and Friday respectively. In addition to triggering auroras, G3 storms can disrupt satellites and technology on Earth. These include intermittent problems with GPS, problems with high-frequency radio signals, and power system bugs, the NOAA said. It may sound ominous, but any issues caused by the storm will be minor and they are extremely unlikely to affect everyday life. Data on the CMEs has been captured by Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory and Solar and Heliospheric Observatory. Dr Phillips highlighted that the storms should lead to showings of the Northern Lights at unusually low latitudes. Writing on spaceweather.com, which tracks the sun's activity, he said that Americans should see them after nightfall on Wednesday. For Europeans, the hours before dawn on March 31 are favoured. \"When chasing auroras, dark skies are essential; go to the countryside,\" Dr Phillips wrote. \"Urban glare can overwhelm auroras even during a strong geomagnetic storm.\" Solar storms are caused by CMEs and solar flares, which are huge expulsions of hot material called plasma from the Sun's outer layer. They can lead to the appearance of colourful auroras by energising particles in our planet's atmosphere Each solar storm is graded by severity on a scale of one to five, with a G1 described as \"minor\" and a G5 as \"extreme\". At the upper end of the scale, storms wreak havoc on our planet's magnetic field, which can disrupt power grids and communications networks. \"Harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth\u2019s atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground,\" Nasa says. \"However \u2013 when intense enough \u2013 they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where GPS and communications signals travel.\" Thankfully, this week's geomagnetic storms are unlikely to significantly impact life or technology on Earth. In the past, larger solar flares have wreaked havoc on our planet. In 1989, a strong solar eruption shot so many electrically charged particles at Earth that the Canadian Province of Quebec lost power for nine hours. As well as causing issues for our tech, they can cause harm to astronauts working on the International Space Station, either through radiation exposure or by interfering with mission control communications. The Earth's magnetic field helps to protect us from the more extreme consequences of solar flares. The sun is currently at the start of a new 11-year solar cycle, which usually sees eruptions and flares grow more intense and extreme. These events are expected to peak around 2025 and it's hoped Nasa's Solar Orbiter spacecraft will observe them all as it aims to fly within 26 million miles of the sun.

The group was envisioned to, like school, have a graduation system that would see its members move on to other units once they hit a certain age. But that original plan was scrapped and, now, the formerly adolescent-focused NCT Dream are navigating adulthood. READ MORE: STAYC say they\u2019re not fazed by their meteoric rise: \u201cIt\u2019s not too difficult or heavy to carry\u201d It\u2019s been six years since the seven-member group\u2019s debut single \u2018Chewing Gum\u2019 and, as rapper Mark Lee noted at the press conference for their second full-length album \u2018Glitch Mode\u2019, they\u2019ve grown up a lot since then. \u201cI think that\u2019s coming out a lot in our music,\u201d he said of their burgeoning maturity, and the new record certainly feels like it was made by an act entering a new phase. Aside from a couple of more in-your-face tracks (more on those later), a lot of \u2018Glitch Mode\u2019 feels fairly lowkey. Perhaps that\u2019s the realisation that comes as you get older that you don\u2019t always need to put on a big display to get people\u2019s attention, but opting for a more comforting or nostalgic atmosphere on much of the tracklist has inconsistent results. \u2018Teddy Bear\u2019 opens with a mumbled rap and hushed singing from Mark and Chenle respectively, eliciting the intimate feeling of sharing whispered thoughts with the lights off and the world around you snoozing. As it progresses, it starts to feel more like a lullaby, particularly when Renjun and Chenle softly command: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about anything / Close your eyes.\u201d NCT Dream. Credit: SM Entertainment Later, \u2018Never Goodbye\u2019 adopts a similar nocturnal spirit, but if \u2018Teddy Bear\u2019 is the soundtrack to the dead of night, its sibling song feels like a companion to the period when day turns to dusk and stars just begin to illuminate the sky. Twinkling, ethereal melodies are sprinkled over steady percussion as NCT Dream acknowledge that sometimes people grow apart and take different paths in life. \u201cIf I can\u2019t find the way to go together with you / I will always shine upon you from afar,\u201d Jaemin promises, a glistening example of the song\u2019s sweet, caring heart. Those tracks might sparkle with tender brilliance, but others fare less well. The acoustic pop of \u2018Drive\u2019 is pleasant but, musically speaking, not particularly memorable, while the smooth and sunny R&B of \u2018It\u2019s Yours\u2019 makes little impact until its rap verses enter the scene. It\u2019s in these moments that the magic of NCT Dream feels lacking, their edges softened too much as they begin a new chapter. The same can\u2019t be said for \u2018Glitch Mode\u2019\u2019s more energetic moments. The album opens with three typically animated songs that bring the group\u2019s experimental and dynamic side into play. Opener \u2018Fire Alarm\u2019 is rowdy and urgent, immediately demanding your attention as the seven-piece chant: \u201cWe set fire, without hesitation we burn / So the world is surprised / We pull the fire alarm, go!\u201d Later, Haechan and Jaemin add, \u201cBurn it down to the ground / That alarm is gonna / Blow, blow, blow, blow, blow\u201d with such infectious energy they almost make you want to do some fire-starting of your own. Elsewhere, the album\u2019s title track mixes clashing sound effects (video game beeps and a revving motor) as it shifts through several gears within minutes. There\u2019s an elastic beat that feels irresistibly cool, a polished pop pre-chorus, lively vocals and, to close, a rock guitar juggernaut of a climax. \u201cIt\u2019s a state of emergency,\u201d they sing as this unfolds. \u201cIt\u2019s a bu-buffering / I\u2019m on that glitch mode.\u201d It would be easy for the whole thing to feel messy and like it was about to fall apart under the weight of so many ideas, but instead it feels surprisingly, impressively cohesive. \u2018Arcade\u2019 boasts an attitude that often gets lost as you move from the heady days of youth into the responsibility of adulthood \u2013 and some good advice to boot. \u201cEven the words that annoy my heart / I chew, eat and spit them out like gum,\u201d Mark raps confidently at one point, later noting: \u201cNo matter what they say, cover your ears / And just be yourself.\u201d Its hip-hop feel is matched on the ultra-slick \u2018Saturday Drip\u2019; a new anthem for weekends spent swaggering around town with your squad. \u201cSaturday drip / Me and my clique / I took it, peak peak,\u201d they purr throughout, while Jaemin boasts the best moment of the album when he declares: \u201cShout \u2018veni vidi vici\u2019 out loud / Like Caesar\u2019s back.\u201d \u2018Glitch Mode\u2019 as a whole feels like a balancing act \u2013 one that wants to keep running with the intense emotions and energy of youth, but also step in a calmer, more mature zone. Finding your footing in the adult world is always a rocky experience and the hit-and-miss junctures of the record reflect that well. Largely, though, NCT Dream have moments of brilliance that show great promise for the unit\u2019s now-extended life path.

The Red Devils famously disbanded their women\u2019s team in 2005 \u2013 the very same month that the 2005 Women\u2019s European Championships had kicked off in Manchester \u2013 in order to focus on their youth set-up. What they envisioned their youth team doing when they became adults is as yet unknown. Grow out of it because it\u2019s just a phase? The team reformed in 2018, and on the surface everything appeared fine. United secured promotion at the first time of asking and slotted in seamlessly to life in the WSL. But manager Casey Stoney quit in May 2021, with complaints over training facilities contributing to her decision to step down, suggesting the club were still not committing to the women\u2019s team as forcefully as they could be. And yet despite previous false starts and under-investment, United put on a spectacle to savour for the women\u2019s team\u2019s first Old Trafford outing in front of fans against Everton on Sunday; from the stadium decor to the 2021/22 WSL season record crowd, it was impressive. The club got everything right and the team turned in a performance befitting of the occasion. A lack of advertising has been a common criticism thrown at women\u2019s teams ahead of potentially high-profile matches in big venues, but with pictures of female United players decking the Old Trafford exterior during the week\u2019s build-up to the fixture, this game was almost impossible to miss. Even the choice of fixture was shrewd. The first time both Tottenham and West Ham hosted WSL matches in their men\u2019s teams\u2019 stadiums, they lost, putting a dampener on the occasion. Spurs used the lure of the north London derby when they played at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for the first time in 2019. Attendance-wise it proved successful, attracting a crowd of 38,262 \u2013 a figure which remains a WSL record. But Arsenal unsurprisingly ran out 2-0 winners, meaning the day largely belonged to the Gunners despite it being on Spurs\u2019 turf. Although partly aided by the fact the fixture fell during the men\u2019s international break, Manchester United picking their clash with struggling Everton for their Old Trafford debut in front of fans was a smart move. While a blockbuster clash against rivals Manchester City may have attracted more supporters, this would come with a greater risk of defeat and post-match deflation. The 3-1 comeback victory over Everton \u2013 with childhood Manchester United fans Alessia Russo and Katie Zelem netting at the Stretford End \u2013 added to the euphoric, party atmosphere at Old Trafford. Despite the illustrious setting, supporters still enjoyed the traditional women\u2019s football treatment at full-time, with players staying behind for pictures and autographs. \u201cThere will be people here that have never experienced women\u2019s football,\u201d manager Marc Skinner said at full time. \u201cMy daughter loves Ella Toone. We\u2019ve never told her to love anyone. She loves Ella Toone and she sings the songs about Ella Toone and that\u2019s because they can see them, they can feel them, they can touch them.

Multiple U.S. players called this team a brotherhood ahead of Wednesday night\u2019s World Cup qualifying finale. But mere moments after the Americans finally sealed their place in Qatar, that brotherhood dispersed.Some players are staying here in the Costa Rican capital until Thursday, while others were scheduled to charter to London overnight. Meanwhile, coach Gregg Berhalter and select U.S. Soccer staff planned to take a red-eye to New York, where they\u2019ll do a few early-morning interviews before boarding a flight to Doha. There, on Friday\u2014fewer than 48 hours after its place was officially assured\u2014the U.S. will learn its opponents in the November-December World Cup.There will be no parade or opulent, organized party, and that big \u2018QUALIFIED\u2019 banner that was unveiled accidentally on Sunday was left behind in Orlando. Instead, the Americans\u2019 long-awaited return to the World Cup, sealed despite Wednesday\u2019s 2-0 loss, was acknowledged quickly with some subdued hugs on the Estadio Nacional field, a salute to the traveling fans, and then, after the sting of defeat had subsided a bit, a healthy dose of champagne and Budweiser in the visiting locker room. This competitive and hungry U.S. squad wanted to close Concacaf\u2019s Octagonal qualifying gauntlet with a historic win. So It took a few additional minutes, and apparently a pre-emptive bottle pop from defender Erik Palmer-Brown, to bring the big picture front and center.\u201cI think it took me a little bit for it to sink in,\u201d said U.S. forward Christian Pulisic, one of three holdovers from the traumatic 2017 qualifying failure who started Wednesday. \u201cOnce we got back in the locker room and just seeing all the guys, I think we\u2019re allowed to be happy and proud that we\u2019re qualified for a World Cup\u2014because this process is not easy.\u201d Brad Smith/ISI Photos/Getty Images The eight World Cup groups, minus a few playoff survivors to be determined, will be revealed Friday, and the U.S. will gather only a few more times before heading to the tournament\u2014it\u2019s 11th overall and first since 2014. So those increasingly euphoric moments together in the dressing room on Wednesday, with Tim Weah manning the team\u2019s new boom box\u2014which was finally acquired in time for this climactic qualifying window\u2014represented a brief but priceless opportunity to rejoice and reflect together before everyone heads their separate ways and Qatar becomes the focus.\u201cIt was muted [at first] because we\u2019re competitors. No one wanted to lose that game,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t win even though you get the reward of qualifying, there is a brief moment of disappointment. For us, it\u2019s about seeing things in perspective, and the perspective is we\u2019re the youngest [U.S.] team to ever qualify for the World Cup \u2026 and we\u2019ll be the youngest team at the World Cup. That\u2019s an accomplishment for these guys.\u201dDeAndre Yedlin, another 2017 holdover, said, \u201cAt first it was a little bit awkward because it\u2019s weird celebrating after a loss. \u2026 But once we really realized, \u2018Man, we qualified and we have achieved this goal that we had,\u2019 then it\u2019s pretty easy after that.\u201dThe Americans\u2019 place in Qatar wasn\u2019t really in doubt prior to kickoff. After deservedly earning four points combined this month in Mexico City and Orlando, the young but maturing U.S. (7-3-4) could afford to lose to Los Ticos by an improbable five goals and still qualify directly thanks to its superior goal differential. As miserable as past trips to Costa Rica have been\u2014the U.S. is now 0-10-2 here all-time\u2014the tension was relatively low.For Berhalter\u2019s team, Wednesday\u2019s match represented a chance to conclude Concacaf\u2019s 14-game, seven-month Octagonal with a satisfying flourish\u2014another box checked. The U.S. wanted the three points, and Berhalter asked the same men he started six days earlier at the Estadio Azteca to chase them. The realistic worst-case scenario was a 90-minute wait for World Cup confirmation and the odd sensation of making history with a loss. Since the 1990 cycle, every U.S. World Cup qualification (except 1994) was sealed with a win.For the hosts, who finished the Octagonal with four straight victories, it was about enjoying its resurgence and preparing for the June playoff against New Zealand. Ticos coach Luis Fernando Su\u00e1rez left little doubt about where his priorities lay when he started just one of nine players carrying a yellow card. Three key Costa Rica veterans at risk of playoff suspension, Celso Borges, Francisco Calvo and Keysher Fuller, didn\u2019t even dress. And superstar goalkeeper Keylor Navas, who stymied the U.S. with multiple sensational saves and six total, left the game in the 79th minute. With modest expectations coming in, Costa Rica was free to cut loose and have a good time. The Estadio Nacional, which feels much larger than its 36,000 capacity thanks to its track and spectacular arched overhangs, was packed and pulsing. A loud, fast-talking and singing emcee. a bunch of costumed mascots and pre-game fireworks launched from behind the south goal set the tone.\u00a0\u201cThe atmosphere gave the guys wings from Costa Rica,\u201d Berhalter said.Although the Americans dominated early, they couldn\u2019t solve Navas. Costa Rica grew into the game and a poor 10-minute stretch midway through the second half sealed the U.S.\u2019s very short-term fate. Costa Rica defender Juan Pablo Vargas and striker Anthony Contreras did the damage.The setback dropped the U.S. to third in the final Octagonal standings. But that\u2019s sufficient. Its ticket is valid, and Wednesday\u2019s result will fade quickly.\u201cThe bottom line is it\u2019s pass-fail. Are you in the World Cup or are you not,\u201d Zimmerman asked. \u201cWe did that. We put ourselves in position to where we could afford to not win the game even though we were going for it.\u201dIt is indeed pass-fail, and despite a steep learning curve for a group lacking Concacaf seasoning; injuries to the likes of Pulisic, Gio Reyna and others; upheaval at center back and striker; and a stiff September test for Berhalter as his team struggled in the opening window and midfield linchpin Weston McKennie was suspended and sent home, the U.S. was never really in mortal danger of repeating its 2017 failure. It was that failure, in fact, that likely led to most of the angst surrounding this campaign. There was some tension following road losses in Panama and Canada, but there was never any genuine jeopardy. Brad Smith/ISI Photos/Getty Images The U.S. didn\u2019t conclude a window below second place until the final whistle Wednesday night (the top three finishers advanced directly to the World Cup). There were no home qualifying defeats like in 2001 or 2016-17. There were no three-game winless runs like in 1997 or 2001 (at one point, the squad that made the World Cup quarterfinals lost three qualifiers in a row). There were no nail-biting, do-or-die games like the 2012 semifinal stage decider against Guatemala in Kansas City, or the must-win match at lowly Barbados in 2000. And the underlying numbers were good. The U.S. played well, for the most part, and led the Octagonal in expected goal difference by a wide margin heading into Wednesday\u2019s finale. For a squad that averages around four years younger than most of the teams that contested the 2018 World Cup, that\u2019s a noteworthy achievement. Once the black qualification T-shirts were distributed and the alcohol started flowing, there was no way Wednesday\u2019s loss was going remove much of that luster.\u201cWe\u2019ve come down and played in some really tough places. We\u2019ve played in some big games and when we\u2019ve needed results, we\u2019ve got them. And I just like the fight of this team and I think we have a lot of quality as well,\u201d Pulisic said. \u201cIn a couple days, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be thinking about this game too much.\u201dIn his post-game press conference, Berhalter shared some of the themes of the locker room speech that was interrupted by Palmer-Brown and his overeager compatriots.\u201cI just had a chance to address the team and just reflecting on these last seven months in particular, and how much this team has grown together. Being the youngest team in the world to qualify for the World Cup is no easy task,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re really proud of the guys, We\u2019re really proud of the way they competed throughout these 14 games. Even tonight, I thought the attitude and the mindset was fantastic, going out there to win the game, not going out there to hang on. So it\u2019s a proud moment for the team, proud moment for U.S. soccer and we\u2019re looking forward to competing in the World Cup.\u201dMore Soccer Coverage:Creditor: USMNT World Cup Roster Projection 1.0\u2014Who Could Go to Qatar?Krum: USMNT\u2019s World Cup Qualifying Timeline of RedemptionMexico Qualifies for Eighth Straight World Cup, Leaps U.S. in Table",

            "content": "Right now, Lismore residents are going through their second major flood in a month. On February 28th, the devastating first flood peaked at 14.4 metres, fully two metres higher than the previous record of 12.27 metres in 1954, and well above the town\u2019s 10-metre-high levee wall, constructed in 2005. Four people died, with 2000 homes destroyed or unlivable of the city\u2019s 19,000. Even as Lismore and Northern Rivers residents struggle to recover from the first flood, the floods are coming again. On March 29th, more heavy rain began falling onto the soaked catchment feeding into Wilsons River. Once again, Lismore\u2019s traumatised community had to evacuate, with predictions of floods of 10.6 metres. The flood only reached 9.7 metres. But then a further 279mm of rain fell between 9am Tuesday and 6am Wednesday 30 March, with an 11 metre flood predicted. Once again, residents had to evacuate. Is this unprecedented? While the height of the first flood is a new record, back to back floods have happened before. Brisbane suffered three of the largest floods then recorded in rapid succession, back in 1893. Floods can come in clusters. As the world warms, the atmosphere can hold more water. That means we are more likely to see larger floods. It is time to consider relocating flood-prone towns. We\u2019ve seen clusters of floods before Lismore is no stranger to floods. The town was built on the meeting place of Wilsons River and Leycester Creek. Lismore\u2019s deep bowl shape has seen the town nicknamed \u201cThe Wok\u201d. As many as 30,000 people live on low-lying land at risk of flood. window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_1_mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); The last major flood in Lismore took place in 2017, reaching 11.59 metres. Only five years later came these devastating floods. That\u2019s an unusually small gap, and many locals were shocked at the small intermission between major floods. Then the second one hit, with almost no break between inundations. While it is unusual, clusters of floods have happened before. In a scenario eerily familiar to the people of Lismore, Brisbane experienced three floods in a month. What\u2019s more, two of these were the largest on record. On February 5th 1893, Brisbane experienced a flood of 8.35 metres. It was the second highest recorded flood since 1841. Bridges, railway lines, businesses and whole streets of houses were destroyed. Roads became canals as the city lay submerged under water. Houses and shops were left coated in foul-smelling mud. There was very little time to recover as the city flooded again on February 11th, though only to 2.4 metres. Just four days later, as the recovery was beginning again, a major new flood swept through the city. Newspapers reported the damage in this 8.09 metre flood was much less than the first, as much of the possible damage had already been done. This was not quite true as many buildings had been significantly weakened from the first inundation. The sodden land and roads were more prone to landslides and collapse. These floods killed 35 people, and left hundreds of people homeless and unemployed. The back to back floods took a psychological toll, with newspapers reporting people were feeling despair and wretchedness. Many in Brisbane in 1893 would have been able to identify with the feeling Lismore Mayor Steve Krieg recently described as \u201cflood fatigue\u201d. Why does Australia suffer from flood clusters? Australia has highly variable rainfall. That\u2019s because of the well-known El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation, a natural climate phenomenon able to make Australia drier or wetter. In El Ni\u00f1o years, rainfall is significantly reduced, leaving us more vulnerable to drought. But in La Ni\u00f1a years, wet weather sets in, making floods more likely. window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_1_hpu-mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); Both 1893 and 2022 are La Ni\u00f1a years. We\u2019re seeing the result of wet summers saturating our river catchments and soils, leaving them less able to absorb heavy rains and more prone to flooding. In La Ni\u00f1a years, large floods are more likely to come in clusters with dry periods in between. We can see this clearly in Lismore\u2019s history. Between 1887 and 1893, the town experienced three major floods, ranging between 10.43 and 12.46 metres. Between 1962 and 1965, the town endured three more floods over 10 metres. And in 1967, Lismore flooded five times between March and June, with floods ranging from 5.09 to 10.27 metres. While La Ni\u00f1a years often come in pairs, the Bureau of Meteorology has warned it is possible to have three consecutive La Ni\u00f1a years, as we\u2019ve seen in 1954-57, 1973-1976 and 1998-2001. All of these caused flooding in Lismore. Thankfully, at this stage it\u2019s considered unlikely that our two years of La Ni\u00f1a will stretch to three. So what can we learn? window.adTech.cmd.push( function() { window.adTech.googletag.display( [ 'ad-slot_1_2_mrec-mobile' ] ); } ); As the world warms, floods are becoming increasing hard to predict. While dams and levee banks can reduce flood damage, they work best in minor and moderate floods. In catastrophic events such as the February flood, there is little they can do. While La Ni\u00f1a years and soaked catchments make floods more likely, they do not guarantee a flood occurring. Scientists have repeatedly warned us climate change can both dry out soils and intensify rainfall depending on the area. That means smaller floods may become less common, but floods that do occur are likely to be more frequent and more intense. As I write, flood records in some parts of northern NSW are tumbling again. The floodwaters at Ballina, Bellingen and Lennox Head are metres above previous heights. While it may not result in another catastrophic flood in Lismore, this will not be the town\u2019s last flood. In fact, the record may be surpassed. It is time to discuss relocating the town away from the floodplain.

            "content": "OKLAHOMA CITY (KFOR) - Women\u2019s sports has been a hot topic for the last few weeks, after a transgender woman won an NCAA swimming race. Today, a controversial bill that would make that participation illegal became law in Oklahoma. Last year, the State Senate failed to hear SB2, what its authors call the \u201cSave Women\u2019s Sports\u201d bill. This year the Senate Pro Temp. Greg Treat said due to that recent event, circumstances have changed. The bill passed through last week to the Governor\u2019s desk. Oklahoma Senate passes bill that would prohibit trans athletes from competing on female sports teams \u201cHow is it fair for female track athletes or swimmers who have been training since they were 12 years old\u00a0 to lose in a high school competition to a biological male? It's simply not fair and it won\u2019t happen in the state of Oklahoma,\u201d said Governor Kevin Stitt. On Wednesday, Governor Stitt signed the bill into law in front of a packed house of legislators and female athletes. SB2 prohibits anyone born biologically male from playing on school athletic teams designated for females, women, or girls. Sen. Julie Daniel of Bartlesville saying, \u201cFive decades of Title IX is going to be very quickly undone taking the scholarships. What about the opportunities for young women? what about leveling the playing field so they can compete at the high level?\u201d \u201cI want to protect her every young woman from having to compete against a guy in their sport. Losing out on scholarships and opportunities and educate benefits is just not right,\u201d said Sen. Micheal Bergstrom of Adair. Senate approves bill to ban use of nonbinary designation on Oklahoma birth certificates But opponents say the bill is written out of fear and ignorance. \u201cSB2 is a dangerous, harmful, slippery slope. It's more than just about sports. This is a slippery slope. Bills like this have a horrifying implication and a ripple effect on our young ones,\u201d said LGBTQ+ activist, Kendra Wilson Clements. However, female athletes at the signing today see things differently. \u201cI believe that all young women deserve the opportunity to excel at whatever sport they choose to be passionate about,\u201d Levi Gladd, current OU athlete. Last year, the NCAA said they would pull their events from states that passed similar bills. But NCAA championships have been held in some of the 12 states that have similar legislation in the last 12 months. \u201cEven if NCAA has problem with it, we are going to do what\u2019s right for all these ladies behind me,\u201d said Stitt. The OU Athletics Department sending out this statement, \"The University of Oklahoma Athletics Department continues to embrace diversity and inclusion and is committed to creating an environment of belonging where those who play for us, work for us and support us are welcomed as their true, authentic selves. We are proud of our long and successful record of hosting NCAA championship events and recognize the opportunities and enjoyment they afford everyone involved, as well as the positive economic impact they have on our communities and our state. We are devoted to working alongside the NCAA to ensure an atmosphere of respect, equal treatment and safety for all.\" Lawsuit filed against Gov. Stitt over birth certificate gender options \u201cSB2 is simply trying to solve a problem that does not exist in the State,\u201d said Cindy Nguyen of ACLU Oklahoma. The OSSAA confirms there have been no documented cases where this has been a problem, but issued a statement saying: \u201cWith Governor Stitt signing the Save Women\u2019s Sports Act in to law this morning at the State Capitol, the Oklahoma Secondary School Activities Association will now comply with the new state law.\u201d \u201cIf it's not happening in Oklahoma, then great, there is nothing to worry about. But we are making sure it doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d said Stitt. But the State of Oklahoma may have other problems on the horizon when it comes to SB2, namely lawsuits. \u201cSo we truly believe that these are unconstitutional. We think we have Supreme Court case law on our side,\u201d said Tamya Cox-Toure of ACLU Oklahoma. \u201cPeople can pursue their life how they see fit, but that doesn\u2019t give you the right to compete in women\u2019s sports,\u201d said Stitt. We reached out to the NCAA for official comment we have not heard back.",

The first eruption was overtaken by the second, making this a cannibal coronal mass ejection. Who is the teacher on the Sacramento strike posters? The charged particles combined to form a more powerful geomagnetic storm. Earth's magnetic field deflects solar winds to the poles. That's where the charged particles interact with our atmosphere to create the dancing lights in the sky. pic.twitter.com/TizexB5b9o\u2014 Adam Epstein (@WeathermanAdam) March 30, 2022 According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Weather Prediction Center, once these particles meet Earth\u2019s magnetic field Wednesday night, the result will be a G3 geomagnetic storm. G3 storms are categorized as strong and often result in mid-latitude auroras.\u00a0 A forecast by the University of Alaska Fairbanks shows the northern lights could possibly be seen in some of the northernmost communities of California and are likely to be seen in much of Oregon and Washington. A cannibal coronal mass ejection happens when fast-moving solar eruptions overtake earlier eruptions in the same region of space, creating a powerful geomagnetic storm. The Space Weather Prediction Center classifies this one as a G3. pic.twitter.com/EpRAY9lUV5\u2014 Adam Epstein (@WeathermanAdam) March 30, 2022 G3 storms have the potential to require voltage corrections, create GPS issues and disrupt satellites.",

            "full_description": "Barcelona made history in their Women\u2019s Champions League win over Real Madrid with over 91,000 fans watching on, which is a women\u2019s football record. A grand total of 91,553 were in attendance at the Camp Nou as Barca ran out 5-2 winners on the night and 8-3 on aggregate in the quarter-final tie. The previous highest turnout for a women\u2019s club game came in 2019 when 60,739 people saw Barcelona win 2-0 away to Atletico Madrid at Wanda Metropolitano. Wednesday evening\u2019s crowd at Europe\u2019s largest stadium also dwarfed the record for spectators at a women\u2019s international, set when 80,203 fans witnessed the United States secure Olympic gold by beating Japan 2-1 at Wembley during London 2012. the record for spectators at a women\u2019s international, set when 80,203 fans witnessed the United States secure Olympic gold by beating Japan 2-1 at Wembley during London 2012. Tickets for the clash at the 99,354 seater stadium had completely sold out and those who attended certainly got their money\u2019s worth. Real briefly threatened to spoil the party after Olga Carmona\u2019s penalty and a fine strike from Claudia Zornoza put them 2-1 ahead on the night following Mapi Leon\u2019s early opener. But Barcelona were not to be denied the El Clasico bragging rights on a historic evening. Second-half goals from Aitana Bonmati, Claudia Pina, Ballon d\u2019Or holder Alexia Putellas and Caroline Hansen comfortably sent them through. They will discover their semi-final opponents on Thursday when 2007 winners Arsenal travel to Volkswagen Arena to take on Wolfsburg with the tie level at 1-1 following last week\u2019s first leg.

The venue will feature 400 seats, a turf field, as well as turf bullpens and a batting tunnel. (Source: Great Lake Canadians) As soon as the weather turns, construction of a new state-of-the-art baseball stadium will begin in Dorchester, Ont. Located at the Field of Dreams site on Hamilton Road, the artificial-surface field will be the new home of the Great Lake Canadians (GLC) amateur organization, with additional use available to Dorchester Minor Baseball (DMB). \u201cWe are hoping to be on it by mid-July,\u201d says Chris Robinson, a Dorchester native, and GLC director of operations. Renderings show a venue which will hold 400 seats, including 100 with VIP chair backs. The stadium will have 50-foot-long dugouts, an extensive batter\u2019s eye, turfed bullpens and a batting tunnel. Any additional amenities will be dependent on funds raised by the GLC program.

The venue will feature 400 seats, a turf field, as well as turf bullpens and a batting tunnel. (Source: Great Lake Canadians) With many connections in the game, GLC owners Adam Stern and Robinson have partnered with the Toronto Blue Jays to secure the former playing surface from Rogers Centre which was replaced in 2021. \u201cWe knew there was kind of a void with turf fields in Ontario and especially for the high-performance kids that have worked so hard to get to where they are now,\u201d says TJ Burton, director of amateur baseball with the Toronto Blue Jays. \u201cWhen we started reaching out to some partners through our Jays Care Foundation we zeroed in on the project in Dorchester. Being turf that is made for Major League Baseball, we felt it was important to be on a surface where high performance CPBL [Canadian Premier Baseball League] baseball was going to be played.\u201d The turf field will allow for teams to play earlier in spring and later in the fall since there is no frost buildup underneath the surface. The Great Lake Canadians U-18 baseball team practices at Centrefield Sports in London, Ont. on Tuesday March 29, 2022. The new stadium in Dorchester, Ont. will be the home of the elite amateur baseball organization. (Brent Lale / CTV News) \u201cI've tried to host a big pre-draft showcase tournament, I think five years running and we haven't had a full start-to-finish tournament yet because of the weather,\u201d says Robinson. \u201cNow that it opens up the opportunity when it stops raining, you get to go play on the turf. We\u2019ve also had some winters where in the middle of February, if you have a nice Saturday, we could be out there using it,\u201d he adds. The project is being funded by the Municipality of Thames Centre which will add another baseball diamond to the five soccer fields at the Outdoor Recreation Complex. \u201cWhen Great Lake\u2019s approached the Blue Jays and got the footing it was a $400,000 value,\u201d says Alison Warwick, mayor of Thames Centre. \u201cIn that partnership, Thames Centre pledged $2.8 million, which directly comes from development charges through growth. So growth is a really good thing for everybody in this area. We\u2019re really excited about using this money because it was always designed to be a premier sports facility and looks like it's going to be that,\u201d she adds. GLC players agree. Curtis McKay is a Dorchester native who plays for the GLC U-18 team, who calls this is a \u201cdream come true\u201d to have this venue five minutes from his home. He believes this type of stadium will put the town of just over 4,000 people on the map in Ontario baseball circles. The former artificial turf from Rogers Centre in Toronto, Ont. sits at the Outdoor Recreation Complex in Dorchester, Ont. It will be used as the surface for the new stadium being built in 2022. (Brent Lale / CTV News) \u201cYou can see it seats a lot people and with the bullpens and the batting cages too and it just, it really makes it feel like a kind of a big league or college atmosphere,\u201d says McKay. \u201cWhen people come here, they\u2019ll be getting the best of the best.\u201d The addition of a second field will also help in the development of players like McKay in the GLC program which has sent 16 players to the pros and more than 100 to college. \u201cWe are completely packed on the existing field out there,\u201d says Robinson. \u201cDorchester Minor Baseball is growing too, so trying to fit everybody on one field gets very difficult. Some of the opportunities are endless when it comes to hosting national events, hosting national team training camps and all the things we're looking forward to doing with some of our contacts in the game.\u201d DMB is scheduled to host a league championship, as well as an Ontario Baseball Association championship this summer. Robinson plans to be able to use both fields, which will eventually require less use of high-end fields in London, St. Marys and Exeter. \u201cI know the soccer people are kind of looking over our shoulder saying, \u2018how'd you do this?\u2019\u201d says Robinson. \u201cIt's a great facility and it's a great sports town. With everything that we've went through in the past two years, the council and township had been so amazing to kind of step up and say our kids need to get out there,\u201d he adds.

Hong)A growing number of governments and companies are adopting net-zero greenhouse gas emissions targets. These targets often evoke nature as a way to store or remove carbon from the atmosphere to counter the climate effect of other emissions. For example, in 2019, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised Greta Thunberg that Canada would plant two billion trees by 2030, and investing in nature is now a key part of Canada\u2019s climate strategy. Forests, peat bogs, wetlands and other ecosystems remove carbon from the atmosphere via photosynthesis and store it in leaves, trunks and roots, and in the soil. But carbon storage in nature is likely temporary because it can be lost again due to either human activities or natural disturbances. In contrast, the climate effect of carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels is effectively permanent. If these efforts to increase natural carbon stocks are short-lived, is there any climate benefit? Our new research suggests that temporary nature-based carbon storage can help achieve our climate goals. However, the most tangible effect \u2014 a decrease in peak warming \u2014 would only occur if we also eliminate fossil fuel emissions. Nature-based climate solutions Nature-based climate solutions are actions that seek to reduce the amount of carbon in the atmosphere by increasing carbon storage in natural systems. Examples include reforestation, nature conservation and improved agricultural practices. They can contribute to climate mitigation by preventing emissions from human land-use activities, or by maintaining and enhancing natural processes that remove carbon from the atmosphere. Read more: How investing in green infrastructure can jump-start the post-coronavirus economy But the carbon stored in nature is unlikely to be permanently removed from the atmosphere. Disturbances like wildfire would cause carbon to be lost back to the atmosphere. Conflicting human land-use priorities can also cause previously protected natural areas to be threatened by industrial activities. If nature-based carbon storage is temporary, then its climate benefit would also be short-lived. We need to think about nature-based climate solutions in relation to other climate mitigation efforts to understand their true benefits. What if nature-based carbon storage is temporary? Carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels have climate effects that persist for centuries. In contrast, nature-based carbon removal will only have a climate effect for as long as the carbon remains stored. In our study, we set out to explore what temporary removal would mean for future climate. We used a climate model to simulate the climate response to temporary removal alongside two different future emissions scenarios. If emissions continue to increase until 2040, followed by gradual decline, global temperatures would rise throughout the century. In this scenario, nature-based carbon removal would only delay the occurrence of a particular warming level. In our highest removal scenario, sequestering a quarter of current annual emissions every year until 2050 only delays the time we reach 1.5 C by a year, and 2 C by eight years. Climate effect of temporary nature-based carbon removal. (Authors) However, if future emissions are decreased rapidly to net-zero by mid-century and then remain net-negative, global temperatures would peak around 1.6 C and then decline during the second half of the century. Here, temporary nature-based carbon removal would decrease the temperature peak by as much as a tenth of a degree. This might seem small, but it is an important and tangible climate benefit that will only occur if the world also succeeds in eliminating fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions over the coming decades. How should we think about nature-based climate solutions? Our results challenge the way nature-based climate solutions are discussed as a climate policy option. Nature-based solutions are often presented as one of many different ways that we could mitigate our impact on climate, and are seen as interchangeable with other climate actions. Alternately, nature-based solutions are used as offsets, explicitly held up as a substitute for other emissions reductions. Both of these framings are problematic. If nature-based carbon storage is temporary, then its climate effect is not equivalent to avoiding fossil fuel carbon dioxide emission. This means that treating nature-based carbon storage as an alternative to other emissions reductions will, at best, delay crossing temperature thresholds. At worst, this could lead to more emissions and long-term warming. Electric vehicles charge at street stations in Norway. (Shutterstock) On the other hand, if we take action to increase natural carbon storage in addition to ambitious emissions reductions, it could contribute to limiting peak warming. Even temporary nature-based carbon storage could have an important climate benefit. The case for better nature conservation and stewardship Our results reveal some of the risks of relying on nature-based climate solutions at the expense of other climate mitigation efforts. However, nature conservation and better stewardship of natural areas can also lead to other positive environmental outcomes. These environmental co-benefits, such as increased biodiversity and improved water and air quality, are also vital to climate resilience. Wetlands, including those that have been damaged and destroyed by peat mining, can be restored to improve carbon storage if managed properly. (Shutterstock) If done in partnership with Indigenous and other local communities, nature-based solutions could also have positive social co-benefits such as supporting livelihoods and cultural values. Taking a holistic view of nature-based climate solutions would help to realize these multiple benefits. It is critical that nature-based climate solutions are not presented as an alternative to other climate mitigation options. As a complementary action however, they could play an important role in meeting both climate and other sustainability goals. H.

Barca Women take on Real Madrid in the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Wednesday night. Tickets for the clash at the 99,354 seater stadium have completely sold out for the occasion, which will make it the highest attendance in the women\u2019s game ever. The match will surpass the attendance at the Wanda Metropolitano in 2019 when Barca defeated Atletico Madrid 2-0, which saw over 60,739 people attend. It is also set to break the record held at 1999 World Cup at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, when the USA defeated China in front of 90,195 spectators. Barca hold a 3-1 lead from the first leg last week in the Spanish capital. Olga Carmona gave Los Blancos the lead, but Barca captain Alexia Putellas equalised with a penalty, before Claudia Pina put them 2-1 ahead. Putellas then added a third in stoppage time to hand her side the healthy advantage. Barcelona Women have been in scintillating form, having become the first Spanish side to win the Champions League with a 4-0 victory over Chelsea, and also won the league and Copa de la Reina in the 2020-21 season.

Real Madrid are yet defeat Barcelona in any competition, losing all eight matches played against them, and have conceded 35 goals while scoring only four. Putellas is looking forward to the opportunity of playing at the iconic stadium, and believes the time is right for her side to grace the Camp Nou turf. \u201cI believe the time has come, it\u2019s the right time to do so,\u2019 Putellas said. \u201cI didn\u2019t picture myself playing in the Nou Camp as a girl as I only saw men playing there. The game can open so many doors for so many girls and I feel proud Barca makes it possible.\u201d \u201cMany girls will dream of being able to play on such a special stage,\u2019 Putellas said. \u201cIt could be a before-and-after moment in women\u2019s football.\u201d Sky Bet: Place any bet and get \u00a330 in free bets \u2013 CLAIM HERE NEW CUSTOMERS ONLY,FIRST SINGLE & E/W BET ONLY, 5p MINIMUM STAKE, 3 x \u00a310 BET TOKENS.

BFW Commentary If you have never been to Green Bay, it is pretty cool. It is hard to think of an American sports city with more of a small town feel. Green Bay is certainly unique in that respect. On the surface it seems like an odd place for such a heavyweight matchup, but it should be a cool atmosphere. If you are going, you should absolutely take the tour of Lambeau Field to soak in some history, If you plan on flying into Milwaukee to attend the match, though, just note it is approximately a two-hour drive from the Milwaukee Airport to Lambeau Field.

The Let Me Love You hitmaker attended the Vanity Fair Oscars Party on Sunday with film director boyfriend Taika Waititi, and admits she \u2018doesn\u2019t remember much\u2019 as she was drinking and dancing the night away. However, there was one thing she did remember \u2013 she missed the moment that had everybody talking, because she was in the bathroom. That being, in the highly unlikely event you haven\u2019t heard, Oscar-winner Will striding on stage and hitting Chris Rock because the comedian joked about Jada Pinkett-Smith, who has alopecia. Speaking on the Fitzy and Wippa radio show on Wednesday, the pop star said she was \u2018very annoyed\u2019 with herself as she admitted missing the show-stopping moment. One of the most famous images to come from the Vanity Fair Oscars Party is a table full of celebrities \u2013 including Taika, Jason Bateman and Ron Howard, looking absolutely shocked as they frantically google what exactly they had just witnessed on stage. The shocking moment Will hit Chris was all anyone could talk about (Picture: Reuters) Hosts Fitzy and Wippa asked Rita why she wasn\u2019t there, to which she admitted she had missed the moment entirely. \u2018I suddenly had to go to the bathroom at that point, which I\u2019m very annoyed about\u2019 she laughed.

When asked if the After Party was buzzing with the drama, Rita brushed it off and insisted she was just there \u2018to have a good time with my friends\u2019, adding she and boyfriend Taika had a fantastic night. Rita insisted she and Taika were staying out of the drama and simply enjoying the night out at the Oscars (Picture: WireImage ) Both Will\u2019s slap and Chris\u2019 joke have proved controversial, being condemned by much of the public, charities and even MPs, although there has also been some support for Will. Will himself has apologised for the incident, saying sorry to the organisers of the awards and to Chris himself with a statement issued the day after the ceremony. The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air actor addressed the shocking incident in an Instagram post, and admitted he was \u2019embarrassed\u2019 by his actions. Will, who cried as he accepted the award for best actor after hitting Chris, later apologised for the violence (Picture: Reuters) \u2018Violence in all of its forms is poisonous and destructive,\u2019 he began. \u2018My behaviour at last night\u2019s Academy Awards was unacceptable and inexcusable. \u2018Jokes at my expense are a part of the job, but a joke about Jada\u2019s medical condition was too much for me to bear and I reacted emotionally.\u2019 More: FootballVirgil van Dijk reacts to Mohamed Salah's World Cup heartbreak and warns Sadio ManeHarry Kane slams England fans who booed Harry Maguire at WembleySadio Mane sends Senegal to Qatar World Cup as Mo Salah targeted by lasers in penalty miss He continued: \u2018I would like to publicly apologise to you, Chris.\u00a0I was out of line and I was wrong. \u2018I am embarrassed and my actions were not indicative of the man I want to be.

Earlier this month, the European Space Agency\u2019s Solar Orbiter captured an amazing view of our host star. The images were snapped on March 7th, as Solar Orbiter passed directly between the Earth and the Sun. There was an explicit reason for this, as the science team wanted to calibrate and compare the images with Earth-based and missions in Earth orbit, to include the Inouye solar observatory, NASA\u2019s Solar Dynamics Observatory and the joint ESA/NASA Solar Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), located at the Lagrange (L1) Sun-Earth point. \u201cFrom this point on-wards, we are \u2018entering the unknown,\u2019 as far as Solar Orbiter\u2019s observations of the Sun are concerned,\u201d says Solar Orbiter Project Scientist Daniel M\u00fcller in a recent press release. The instruments used aboard the spacecraft included the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) and the Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment (SPICE) imager. The EUI image alone represents the highest full disk resolution image of the Sun, looking right down through and capturing the corona and outer solar atmosphere. It\u2019s definitely worth a scroll through and zoom in: EUI full disc image of the Sun. Credit: ESA/Solar Orbiter Team. Click here for a full resolution zoomable view. The full disk SPICE image captures the Sun at the Lyman-beta wavelength in the ultraviolet, and represents one of the first images of its kind taken in 50 years, since the solar observation experiments aboard Skylab. Solar Orbiter snapped these images over a 4-hour session, while the probe was 75 million kilometers from the Sun, interior to the orbit of Venus. The Sun was large enough (two degrees across) from that distance that EUI needed a mosaic of 25 images to cover the entire disc of the Sun. The final result is laid out in a 9148 by 9112 grid of 83 million pixels, with a resolution 10 times better than your 4K TV screen. The image includes filaments, nano-flares and spicules seen across the roiling surface of the Sun. Solar Orbiter observations will address the key question of how eruptions are born on the surface of the Sun, by characterizing the temperature of the Sun seen through successive layers. You\u2019d think that the Sun gets cooler, out through successive layers farther out\u2026 but the reverse is actually the case, as the outer corona reaches a million degrees versus the surface of the photosphere, at a relatively cool 5,000 degrees Celsius. SPICE\u2019s temperature view of the Sun: one layer at a time. Credit: ESA The SPICE sequence in particular shows temperature layers in color versus elemental composition: yellow (neon) at 630,000 degrees Celsius, green (oxygen) at 320,000 degrees Celsius, blue (carbon) 32,000 degrees Celsius, and purple (hydrogen) at a \u2018cool\u2019 10,000 degrees Celsius.

The mission comes at an auspicious time, as Solar Cycle 25 gets underway in earnest this year, en route to its peak around 2025, which may be one of the most powerful in decades.

Passages near Venus will gradually change the inclination of Solar Orbiter\u2019s path, gradually giving us views of the elusive polar regions of the Sun.

The EUI image alone represents the highest full disk resolution image of the Sun, looking right down through and capturing the corona and outer solar atmosphere. It\u2019s definitely worth a scroll through and zoom in: The full disk SPICE image captures the Sun at the Lyman-beta wavelength in the ultraviolet, and represents one of the first images of its kind taken in 50 years, since the solar observation experiments aboard Skylab. Solar Orbiter snapped these images over a 4-hour session, while the probe was 75 million kilometers from the Sun, interior to the orbit of Venus. The Sun was large enough (two degrees across) from that distance that EUI needed a mosaic of 25 images to cover the entire disc of the Sun. The final result is laid out in a 9148 by 9112 grid of 83 million pixels, with a resolution 10 times better than your 4K TV screen. The image includes filaments, nano-flares and spicules seen across the roiling surface of the Sun. Solar Orbiter observations will address the key question of how eruptions are born on the surface of the Sun, by characterizing the temperature of the Sun seen through successive layers. You\u2019d think that the Sun gets cooler, out through successive layers farther out\u2026 but the reverse is actually the case, as the outer corona reaches a million degrees versus the surface of the photosphere, at a relatively cool 5,000 degrees Celsius. The SPICE sequence in particular shows temperature layers in color versus elemental composition: yellow (neon) at 630,000 degrees Celsius, green (oxygen) at 320,000 degrees Celsius, blue (carbon) 32,000 degrees Celsius, and purple (hydrogen) at a \u2018cool\u2019 10,000 degrees Celsius. Launched on February 10 th , 2020 atop an Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral Space Force (at the time, Air Force) Station, Solar Orbiter has a primary seven year mission to study the Sun. The mission comes at an auspicious time, as Solar Cycle 25 gets underway in earnest this year, en route to its peak around 2025, which may be one of the most powerful in decades. Solar Orbiter just reached its closest perihelion yet this past weekend, passing 50 million kilometers from the Sun interior to the orbit of Mercury. Passages near Venus will gradually change the inclination of Solar Orbiter\u2019s path, gradually giving us views of the elusive polar regions of the Sun.

            "content": "For the last several years, the Bruins have become known for eye-catching floor routines that make you want to dance along. Jerome Miron/USA TODAY Sports Jordan Chiles let out a joyous shriek as she nailed her final tumbling pass then hit her ending pose. The crowd at Pauley Pavilion roared, and Chiles barely saluted the judges before her teammates mobbed her, all shouting for a 10. The atmosphere at the early February matchup was electric as UCLA faced its Pac-12 rival Utah, and neither team disappointed. The Bruins closed out the meet on floor exercise with back-to-back routines from Chiles, a freshman, and sophomore Chae Campbell. The Utes came away with a nail-biting victory, 197.750 to 197.650.UCLA has become known for eye-catching floor routines. From Sophina DeJesus incorporating the whip and nae nae in 2016 to Katelyn Ohashi\u2019s iconic Michael Jackson (\u201918) and Beyonc\u00e9/Tina Turner mashup (\u201919) performances to Nia Dennis\u2019s \u201cBlack Excellence\u201d routine last season, there is an expectation that the Bruins will continue to push the boundaries. Campbell and Chiles helped UCLA to a fourth-place finish at the Pac-12 championships behind Utah, California and Oregon State. The Bruins will face No. 3 Michigan, Maryland and the winner of the Townson\u2013North Carolina play-in meet March 31 in the second session of the Raleigh regional. No. 6 LSU, No. 11 Missouri, Iowa and NC State will battle it out in the first session of Thursday\u2019s competition. The top-two teams from each session will advance to the regional final April 2. From there, the two highest-scoring squads will advance to the NCAA championships.Chiles spent her fall touring with Simone Biles\u2019s Gold Over America Tour and joined the Bruins squad in December, just a month before the season started. The Utah meet marked just the second time Chiles appeared in the floor lineup. The 20-year-old pairs her difficult, high-flying tumbling with precise landings and sharp dance to create a stunning routine that earned the Olympic silver medalist her first career 10.0.She learned her floor routine, which includes music from her favorite artist Normani, in just two days. UCLA volunteer choreographer BJ Das, who got to know Chiles while working on the GOAT Tour, marveled at how quickly the routine came together. \u201cWe had a lot of pressure because we were in a time crunch, and we both dove in headfirst,\u201d Das says. \u201cWe were like, Yeah do that. O.K. try this. Now do this, all right, that. Ideas were flowing. We did that routine in like, two short sessions, like two days.\u201dCampbell was drawn to UCLA on floor before she joined the squad in 2020. Now a sophomore, she remembers focusing on the Bruins\u2019 performance quality and the little details that made each routine stand out, including eye contact, which is something she and her teammates practice day in and day out in the gym. This season, Campbell\u2019s routine has a \u201cdance hall theme, which is very authentic to the dance industry and their style.\u201d It took some time to find the right cuts of music to make it cohesive for an audience. The choreography, Das says, is \u201cvery detailed and catered to [Campbell].\u201d In a home meet against Washington in late February, the sophomore added a more difficult opening tumbling pass\u2014a full-twisting double-tuck\u2014to fit the music and picked up a 10.0 of her own. She credits Das for UCLA\u2019s ability to push the boundaries of what a floor routine can look like. The poses aren\u2019t the \u201ctypical poses you see a lot in elite,\u201d and each exercise is created for the individual athlete. UCLA can have a lineup ranging from the dramatic elegance of Brooklyn Moors to the boundless, hyped energy of Sekai Wright. Das arrived in Westwood before the 2020 season after a yearlong stint as a volunteer choreographer with Utah. Former UCLA head coach Valorie Kondos Field announced her retirement before the \u201919 season, leaving a hole on the choreography side for the Bruins. Das already lived in Los Angeles and had attended UCLA meets, where some alumni encouraged Das to give it a shot. For Das, the decision became easier after watching the types of routines UCLA showcased in previous seasons.\u201cI\u2019m like, Oh, man, this girl\u2019s doing a Beyonc\u00e9 routine. Where was this when I was a gymnast?\u201d Das says. \u201cSomeone\u2019s doing Michael Jackson. Wait a sec, they\u2019re doing this without me. This is like my dream; how is this happening?\u201dHer process differs from athlete to athlete but nearly always begins with the music. She stresses authenticity and finding a style or theme that excites the athlete she\u2019s working with. From there, Das builds playlists of songs that could potentially be part of a floor routine. (Nia Dennis, whose senior year routine went viral in 2021, estimates that she had a list of about 80 songs to pick from.) The music can present its own challenge, though. Floor routines aren\u2019t allowed to have any lyrics and finding the right instrumental versions can be tricky.\u201cA lot of songs sound more powerful or interesting with lyrics,\u201d Das says, \u201cso it\u2019s a challenge in itself to find music that can tell a story or be exciting to perform to without those lyrics. That\u2019s sometimes where we get stuck even in the beginning.\u201dOnce the music choices are selected, Das listens to it constantly\u2014in the car, at home, \u201cwhenever I\u2019m not busy.\u201d If she isn\u2019t able to find the instrumentals herself, she doesn\u2019t back away from reaching out to artists on social media, record labels, managers or even those she knows, such as Janet Jackson\u2019s choreographer. Then, she either cuts the music herself or has a friend in the music industry mix it for her. Once that\u2019s all settled, it\u2019s finally time to start putting together the choreography. Das\u2019s background began in gymnastics. She competed as a Level 10 club gymnast and then collegiately at Washington before injuries ended her career. But Das found a silver lining. She shifted her focus to dance and began taking classes and private lessons. After spending most of her life as a gymnast, she \u201ctook that gymnastics work ethic and applied it to dance.\u201d She moved to L.A. about a year after graduating, signed with an agency and started using her gymnastics skills for work. Das found herself up against dancers who started perfecting their craft from a young age, similar to most gymnasts. Her gymnastics background gave her \u201ca leg up in the industry\u201d as she caught up. Some of her earliest jobs included dancing on Avril Lavigne\u2019s world tour in 2008 and for Miley Cyrus at the Nickelodeon Kids\u2019 Choice Awards. She\u2019s performed at the Academy Awards (\u201914), American Music Awards (\u201918) and the Grammys (\u201919). She even dipped her toes in the water by choreographing some floor routines for local clubs back home in Seattle as a side gig. Das didn\u2019t intend to focus on that as a career until she got a call from a friend who worked with Utah\u2019s team and saw how the sport had evolved to incorporate dance into routines.The third-year volunteer coach avoids putting pressure on the first session she has with any of the athletes. She wants them to enjoy the creative process and encourages them to bring friends or teammates with them. Then they dance. Routines aren\u2019t necessarily linear, Das says. Sometimes, a particular part of the music sticks out and that becomes a starting point. \u201cIt\u2019s different for everyone, but I think the main theme is that I want it to be collaborative,\u201d Das says. \u201cI want it to be authentic, and I want it to be playful and fun when they\u2019re creating with me.\u201d Robert Hanashiro/USA TODAY Sports Nia Dennis knows what it\u2019s like to have a viral floor routine. She\u2019s done it in back-to-back seasons. As a junior, her Beyonc\u00e9 routine took the internet by storm, and last season\u2019s meaningful \u201cBlack Excellence\u201d routine garnered 3.6 million views. Dennis started with her theme, Black culture, and focused on what represented her as a woman. \u201cI wanted to bring [Black culture] to the sport of gymnastics, which isn\u2019t so common,\u201d Dennis says. \u201cIt\u2019s not common to see Black culture in the sport of gymnastics. That\u2019s music style, dance style, and gymnastics style even isn\u2019t so common. I wanted to bring more of it to the sport of gymnastics.\u201dDennis and Das worked together to create the choreography, a process that Dennis says was the \u201ccomplete opposite\u201d of what she experienced as an elite gymnast. But it was a welcome change. Dennis loves to dance, and Das gave her the freedom to give her own ideas and input into the routine. \u201cIt was just so much fun, honestly,\u201d she says. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like a chore; it didn\u2019t feel like I was preparing for season. It felt like I\u2019m learning the best dance routine of all time.\u201dFrom there, Dennis worked with the coaching staff to figure out her tumbling passes. NCAA teams compete weekend after weekend between January and March with the postseason meets continuing into April. The long season means focusing on tumbling skills that are consistent from week to week while also managing any nagging injuries that crop up. Dennis struggled early in her career with running out of bounds on her first pass and worked through three different skills before settling on one that worked best for her. Coming into her final season last year, she knew that she wanted to keep her second and third tumbling runs the same as her junior-year routine with some wiggle room to upgrade her opening pass on any given week. Das prefers to work through several shorter choreography sessions before the fine tuning begins. UCLA does a preseason event called Meet the Bruins, which is often televised. It gives Das a chance to watch every routine and see how it looks on camera. She takes her combined experience of dancing on tours and award shows with choreographing for television and uses it to continue to refine each routine. Movements that might look too small are adjusted, and that comes from Das dancing on tours or at awards shows in which it\u2019s important for those sitting far away to still see every move. Likewise, if there\u2019s just something that \u201clooks weird on camera\u201d that Das didn\u2019t recognize in person, she\u2019ll tweak that as well. Even once the season begins, Das will sometimes make small changes just to keep things interesting for the athlete competing.The first thing fans can always expect at a home meet is the dance party vibe that takes over the arena as UCLA moves to its final rotation. The Bruins thrive most when they\u2019re loose. As each gymnast steps up to compete, what\u2019s happening around the floor draws eyes almost as much as the routine on the floor. Teammates are spread around the mat, cheering every tumbling pass and doing the choreography with the athlete on the floor. Even Das gets involved. Learning one another\u2019s routines is something that both Campbell and Dennis say takes absolutely no time at all during preseason.Elsewhere in the arena, the UCLA student section, known as The Den, is on its feet. The students interact with the gymnast on the floor and even, according to Dennis, send a couple of people to practice to watch and learn the choreography. That support is invaluable to the athletes competing.\u201cThey\u2019ll learn certain parts of our floor routines so that when we go to the meets they\u2019ll know when to do it with us, and they can come in with us,\u201d Dennis says. \u201cWe have this extended team that goes all the way up Pauley. If you\u2019re ever nervous while you\u2019re performing and then you look up and see the student section doing it with you, that just makes you not nervous.\u201d In a lineup brimming with options, Chiles and Campbell stand out as routines with the potential to grab attention. Like their teammates, they are absolutely committed to their performance and match great choreography with breathtaking tumbling. Both athletes have picked up perfect 10s this season inside of Pauley Pavilion, including a run of three straight meets between Feb. 27 and March 12. The Bruins cracked a 197.000 team score in each of those competitions. Chiles described that moment as \u201caweing\u201d for the freshman. Campbell has anchored the floor lineup in all but two meets this season and said after the Washington meet that before her routine she asked herself, Why not get a 10 today?But both were quick to say that their routines weren\u2019t created with the intention of going viral. Chiles wanted her routine to be fun, representative of her and \u201csomething that little kids would be able to dance to.\u201d Campbell agrees. \u201cThere\u2019s really no formula for a viral routine,\u201d she says. \u201cThere really isn\u2019t. I think it just comes down to a person and how they take what they\u2019re given and how they perform it.\u201dDas credits those who came before her at UCLA, ranging from the former coach Kondos Field, to gymnasts such as Ohashi, DeJesus and Hallie Mosset. She looks back to Oregon State\u2019s Tasha Smith and to ex-LSU superstar Lloimincia Hall, whose routines broke through for being innovative and different.\u201cThere\u2019s so many people who set us up for success that did these popular routines at the right time when social media was looking for something to shake things up in the sport,\u201d Das says. \u201cIt\u2019s so unexpected. People are expecting a poised, perfect gymnast to point their toes and have balletic kind of poses and violin music, and then someone latches on to that on the internet and sees this cool music and popular moves and they\u2019re like, Wait a second. It\u2019s something exciting and almost rebellious about it. I think that that started to pave the way.\u201d",

            "full_description": "Jerome Miron/USA TODAY Sports Jordan Chiles let out a joyous shriek as she nailed her final tumbling pass then hit her ending pose. The crowd at Pauley Pavilion roared, and Chiles barely saluted the judges before her teammates mobbed her, all shouting for a 10. The atmosphere at the early February matchup was electric as UCLA faced its Pac-12 rival Utah, and neither team disappointed. The Bruins closed out the meet on floor exercise with back-to-back routines from Chiles, a freshman, and sophomore Chae Campbell. The Utes came away with a nail-biting victory, 197.750 to 197.650. UCLA has become known for eye-catching floor routines. From Sophina DeJesus incorporating the whip and nae nae in 2016 to Katelyn Ohashi\u2019s iconic Michael Jackson (\u201918) and Beyonc\u00e9/Tina Turner mashup (\u201919) performances to Nia Dennis\u2019s \u201cBlack Excellence\u201d routine last season, there is an expectation that the Bruins will continue to push the boundaries. Campbell and Chiles helped UCLA to a fourth-place finish at the Pac-12 championships behind Utah, California and Oregon State. The Bruins will face No. 3 Michigan, Maryland and the winner of the Townson\u2013North Carolina play-in meet March 31 in the second session of the Raleigh regional. No. 6 LSU, No. 11 Missouri, Iowa and NC State will battle it out in the first session of Thursday\u2019s competition. The top-two teams from each session will advance to the regional final April 2. From there, the two highest-scoring squads will advance to the NCAA championships. Chiles spent her fall touring with Simone Biles\u2019s Gold Over America Tour and joined the Bruins squad in December, just a month before the season started. The Utah meet marked just the second time Chiles appeared in the floor lineup. The 20-year-old pairs her difficult, high-flying tumbling with precise landings and sharp dance to create a stunning routine that earned the Olympic silver medalist her first career 10.0 . She learned her floor routine, which includes music from her favorite artist Normani, in just two days. UCLA volunteer choreographer BJ Das, who got to know Chiles while working on the GOAT Tour, marveled at how quickly the routine came together. \u201cWe had a lot of pressure because we were in a time crunch, and we both dove in headfirst,\u201d Das says. \u201cWe were like, Yeah do that. O.K. try this. Now do this, all right, that . Ideas were flowing. We did that routine in like, two short sessions, like two days.\u201d Campbell was drawn to UCLA on floor before she joined the squad in 2020. Now a sophomore, she remembers focusing on the Bruins\u2019 performance quality and the little details that made each routine stand out, including eye contact, which is something she and her teammates practice day in and day out in the gym. This season, Campbell\u2019s routine has a \u201cdance hall theme, which is very authentic to the dance industry and their style.\u201d It took some time to find the right cuts of music to make it cohesive for an audience. The choreography, Das says, is \u201cvery detailed and catered to [Campbell].\u201d In a home meet against Washington in late February, the sophomore added a more difficult opening tumbling pass\u2014a full-twisting double-tuck\u2014to fit the music and picked up a 10.0 of her own . She credits Das for UCLA\u2019s ability to push the boundaries of what a floor routine can look like. The poses aren\u2019t the \u201ctypical poses you see a lot in elite,\u201d and each exercise is created for the individual athlete. UCLA can have a lineup ranging from the dramatic elegance of Brooklyn Moors to the boundless, hyped energy of Sekai Wright. Das arrived in Westwood before the 2020 season after a yearlong stint as a volunteer choreographer with Utah. Former UCLA head coach Valorie Kondos Field announced her retirement before the \u201919 season, leaving a hole on the choreography side for the Bruins. Das already lived in Los Angeles and had attended UCLA meets, where some alumni encouraged Das to give it a shot. For Das, the decision became easier after watching the types of routines UCLA showcased in previous seasons. \u201cI\u2019m like, Oh, man, this girl\u2019s doing a Beyonc\u00e9 routine. Where was this when I was a gymnast? \u201d Das says. \u201c Someone\u2019s doing Michael Jackson. Wait a sec, they\u2019re doing this without me. This is like my dream; how is this happening? \u201d Her process differs from athlete to athlete but nearly always begins with the music. She stresses authenticity and finding a style or theme that excites the athlete she\u2019s working with. From there, Das builds playlists of songs that could potentially be part of a floor routine. (Nia Dennis, whose senior year routine went viral in 2021, estimates that she had a list of about 80 songs to pick from.) The music can present its own challenge, though. Floor routines aren\u2019t allowed to have any lyrics and finding the right instrumental versions can be tricky. \u201cA lot of songs sound more powerful or interesting with lyrics,\u201d Das says, \u201cso it\u2019s a challenge in itself to find music that can tell a story or be exciting to perform to without those lyrics. That\u2019s sometimes where we get stuck even in the beginning.\u201d Once the music choices are selected, Das listens to it constantly\u2014in the car, at home, \u201cwhenever I\u2019m not busy.\u201d If she isn\u2019t able to find the instrumentals herself, she doesn\u2019t back away from reaching out to artists on social media, record labels, managers or even those she knows, such as Janet Jackson\u2019s choreographer. Then, she either cuts the music herself or has a friend in the music industry mix it for her. Once that\u2019s all settled, it\u2019s finally time to start putting together the choreography. Das\u2019s background began in gymnastics. She competed as a Level 10 club gymnast and then collegiately at Washington before injuries ended her career. But Das found a silver lining. She shifted her focus to dance and began taking classes and private lessons. After spending most of her life as a gymnast, she \u201ctook that gymnastics work ethic and applied it to dance.\u201d She moved to L.A. about a year after graduating, signed with an agency and started using her gymnastics skills for work. Das found herself up against dancers who started perfecting their craft from a young age, similar to most gymnasts. Her gymnastics background gave her \u201ca leg up in the industry\u201d as she caught up. Some of her earliest jobs included dancing on Avril Lavigne\u2019s world tour in 2008 and for Miley Cyrus at the Nickelodeon Kids\u2019 Choice Awards. She\u2019s performed at the Academy Awards (\u201914), American Music Awards (\u201918) and the Grammys (\u201919). She even dipped her toes in the water by choreographing some floor routines for local clubs back home in Seattle as a side gig. Das didn\u2019t intend to focus on that as a career until she got a call from a friend who worked with Utah\u2019s team and saw how the sport had evolved to incorporate dance into routines. The third-year volunteer coach avoids putting pressure on the first session she has with any of the athletes. She wants them to enjoy the creative process and encourages them to bring friends or teammates with them. Then they dance. Routines aren\u2019t necessarily linear, Das says. Sometimes, a particular part of the music sticks out and that becomes a starting point. \u201cIt\u2019s different for everyone, but I think the main theme is that I want it to be collaborative,\u201d Das says. \u201cI want it to be authentic, and I want it to be playful and fun when they\u2019re creating with me.\u201d Robert Hanashiro/USA TODAY Sports Nia Dennis knows what it\u2019s like to have a viral floor routine. She\u2019s done it in back-to-back seasons. As a junior, her Beyonc\u00e9 routine took the internet by storm, and last season\u2019s meaningful \u201cBlack Excellence\u201d routine garnered 3.6 million views. Dennis started with her theme, Black culture, and focused on what represented her as a woman. \u201cI wanted to bring [Black culture] to the sport of gymnastics, which isn\u2019t so common,\u201d Dennis says. \u201cIt\u2019s not common to see Black culture in the sport of gymnastics. That\u2019s music style, dance style, and gymnastics style even isn\u2019t so common. I wanted to bring more of it to the sport of gymnastics.\u201d Dennis and Das worked together to create the choreography, a process that Dennis says was the \u201ccomplete opposite\u201d of what she experienced as an elite gymnast. But it was a welcome change. Dennis loves to dance, and Das gave her the freedom to give her own ideas and input into the routine. \u201cIt was just so much fun, honestly,\u201d she says. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like a chore; it didn\u2019t feel like I was preparing for season. It felt like I\u2019m learning the best dance routine of all time.\u201d From there, Dennis worked with the coaching staff to figure out her tumbling passes. NCAA teams compete weekend after weekend between January and March with the postseason meets continuing into April. The long season means focusing on tumbling skills that are consistent from week to week while also managing any nagging injuries that crop up. Dennis struggled early in her career with running out of bounds on her first pass and worked through three different skills before settling on one that worked best for her. Coming into her final season last year, she knew that she wanted to keep her second and third tumbling runs the same as her junior-year routine with some wiggle room to upgrade her opening pass on any given week. Das prefers to work through several shorter choreography sessions before the fine tuning begins. UCLA does a preseason event called Meet the Bruins, which is often televised.

Vande Hei made his way to the International Space Station on April 9th last year and spent 355 days in orbit, eclipsing Scott Kelly's record of 340 continuous days spent outside our planet's atmosphere. This concludes Vande Hei's second spaceflight, bringing his total number of days spent in space to 523.\u00a0The American astronaut made the journey back to Earth with Russian cosmonauts Anton Shkaplerov and Pyotr Dubrov aboard the Soyuz MS-19 spacecraft. There were fears that Roscosmos would leave Vande Hei stranded in space after the US imposed sanctions against Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. NASA would've had to rely on private companies, such as SpaceX, to transport him back. Russian space agency Roscosmos issued a statement assuring everyone that it will ferry Vande Hei back home, though, proclaiming that the agency \"has never given reason to doubt its reliability as a partner.\"\u00a0The three passengers closed the hatch to their Soyuz spacecraft at 11:30PM EDT on March 29th. They undocked at 2:45AM on March 30th and touched down at 7:28AM (5:28AM local time) in Kazakhstan. While he was aboard the ISS, Vande Hei contributed to dozens of studies conducted on the station, including six investigations by NASA's Human Research Program. His contributions will help the agency and commercial space companies prepare better for long-duration spaceflights to destinations farther than the ISS in the future.\u00a0",

            "content": "Anthony Kwan/Getty ImagesSince its debut in 2009, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have seen explosive growth and some dramatic downturns. Cryptocurrencies now inhabit an increasingly prominent niche in the global financial landscape, offering \u201cpastime\u201d opportunities for young investors, channelling donations to Ukraine\u2019s war effort or simply providing cheaper and faster alternatives to mainstream banking. In Aotearoa New Zealand, the Reserve Bank recently decided to investigate crypto as part of a wider conversation about how New Zealanders will pay and save in the future. So far, crypto has benefited from light regulation in New Zealand, but it\u2019s essential we have a clear picture of all pros and cons, including the risk of criminal behaviour and climate change impacts. Cryptocurrencies offer a variety of investment and transaction benefits, but concerns about dangers are also growing. Crypto\u2019s volatile track record presents significant risk to investors (alongside significant reward) and the relative anonymity of Bitcoin, Ethereum and others is proving attractive to organised crime, money laundering and tax evasion. Read more: Crypto theft is on the rise. Here's how the crimes are committed, and how you can protect yourself To date, crypto has largely avoided the traditional forms of financial regulation banks face and it has capitalised on its ability to eschew territorial borders, being everywhere and nowhere at once. As calls for effective regulation get louder and major markets in the US, EU and Asia seek to subject crypto to greater oversight, it is particularly important to highlight crypto\u2019s growing but often hidden environmental impact. Bitcoin uses more energy than most countries How do companies with only virtual assets contribute to environmental damage? The answer is data mining. Cryptocurrencies and assets use blockchain technology. In essence, transactions are verified and recorded on a blockchain, a public digital ledger that contains information about all transactions. Blockchain technology ensures the integrity of crypto transactions, but it does so by using huge amounts of electricity. Bitcoin\u2019s annual electricity consumption is more than three times that of New Zealand. This is due to blockchain\u2019s distributed nature and use of cryptography and complex processing, which require considerable computational power. Read more: Bitcoin: China's crackdown isn't enough \u2013 only a global effort can stop crypto's monstrous energy demand Verifying transactions, or mining, is so energy intensive it has caused concerns about the resilience of some countries\u2019 electricity supply. Earlier this year, Kazakhstan cut off crypto miners because of the country\u2019s energy crisis. When the electricity used by crypto comes from fossil fuels, the connection to climate change becomes clearer. Recent developments in the US are setting a worrying trend. Crypto\u2019s colossal energy needs may be met by electricity from coal-fired power stations, at a time when the energy sector should pivot towards renewables. In Kentucky, a new crypto \u201cblockchain farm\u201d is being built close to four coal-fired power plants, for easy energy supply. Meanwhile, another coal-fired power station in Montana has been brought back from the brink of closure after agreeing to act as the sole electricity supplier to a Bitcoin mining company, Marathon, adding hundreds of thousands of tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Cryptocurrencies and climate change The need to act decisively on climate change has never been more urgent. Last year, New Zealand announced its new Nationally Determined Contribution to cut emissions by 50% on 2005 levels by 2030 as part of collective efforts to limit global temperature rise to 1.5\u2103 above pre-industrial levels. This is an improvement on the previous pledge, but Climate Action Tracker still rates New Zealand\u2019s overall contribution to climate change mitigation as \u201chighly insufficient\u201d. The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), released last month, details the impacts of overshooting the 1.5\u2103 target. For Australasia, these include increased heat-related deaths and disease for people and wildlife, loss of livelihoods and a drop in income from agriculture and loss of low-lying coastal areas as a result of rising sea levels. Insufficient action on climate change now will have serious consequences, including close to home. According to a recent survey, most New Zealanders accept the need to take action to combat climate change. But all too often people\u2019s lifestyle decisions still seem disconnected from their environmental impacts. Confusion remains around what people can meaningfully do to make positive change. Read more: Cryptocurrency has an impact on economies. That's why some are afraid of it \u2013 and some welcome it Regarding crypto, to make informed and responsible choices, New Zealanders need a clear picture of how our consumer and investment decisions affect the planet. Public and private sectors should explore more environmentally friendly blockchain technology based on \u201cproof-of-stake\u201d which uses less energy because of lower processing requirements. Indeed, the European Parliament considered banning the more energy-hungry \u201cproof-of-work\u201d mechanism Bitcoin and other popular cryptocurrencies use. While it backed off the proposal, cryptocurrencies will likely face further scrutiny as the EU tries to tackle the climate crisis. Aotearoa also needs a future-facing regulatory framework to limit the use of energy-hungry encryption and support a safer and more sustainable model for consumers and the planet.

So these stars take on an orange-red appearance, hence the red giant moniker. Enlarge / V Hydrae is a carbon-rich star located 1,300 light-years away in the constellation Hydra. IAU and Sky & Telescope Eventually, the helium in a red giant's core will be spent, and the core will shrink again. The star then becomes an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star (the final red giant stage). The interior structure of an AGB star consists of a central core of carbon and oxygen, a shell where fusion is turning helium into carbon, and another shell where hydrogen is turning into helium. These stars typically produce dramatic pulses of increased brightness every 100 to 1,000 days. In addition, intense surface winds cause a gaseous cloud known as a circumstellar envelope to form around the star. Advertisement Those intense stellar winds will eventually expel the atmosphere and stellar envelope, and the star will become a white dwarf star within a planetary nebula. The faster the rate at which an AGB star loses its mass, the closer it is to that final transition. Our Sun will eventually become a red giant in about 5 billion years, eventually progressing to an AGB before finally evolving into a planetary nebula with a white dwarf star at its center. That's the process as astronomers have understood it for years. The unusual characteristics of V Hya have them rethinking matters, however. Located 1,300 light-years away in the constellation Hydra, V Hya is a carbon-rich star, meaning its atmosphere contains more carbon than oxygen. It has a high loss rate for its mass, so astronomers surmise that it's probably in the process of shedding its atmosphere to become a planetary nebula. Enlarge / Rendering showing the carbon-rich star V Hya in its final act. ALMA (ESO/NAOJ/NRAO)/S. Dagnello (NRAO/AUI/NSF) This AGB star is also intriguing because every eight years or so, there are large plasma eruptions, and sharp decreases in brightness occur roughly every 17 years. These events suggest the presence of a companion star that is barely visible. (The dips in brightness could be caused by a cloud linked to this second star passing in front of V Hya.) This latest study combines data from the Hubble Space Telescope with observations using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), incorporating infrared, optical, and ultraviolet data to capture V Hya's death throes across multiple wavelengths. The star is far away and surrounded by dense dust, but the higher resolution capabilities of ALMA revealed its rings and outflows in great detail. The timing was also serendipitous. \u201cV Hya is in the brief but critical transition phase that dying stars go through at the end of their lives,\u201d said co-author Raghvendra Sahai , an astronomer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \u201cIt\u2019s the phase when they lose most of their mass. It\u2019s likely that this phase does not last very long, so it is difficult to catch them in the act. We got lucky with V Hya, and were able to image all of the different activities going on in and around this star to better understand how dying stars lose mass at the end of their lives.\u201d Advertisement Sahai and his co-authors found that the star is shedding its atmosphere by blowing a series of smoke rings, which have expanded outward over the last 2,100 years or so to form a dusty disk-like region around V Hya. The team dubbed that structure DUDE (disk undergoing dynamical expansion). Their observations also revealed high-speed blasts of gas expelled from the star in opposite directions, perpendicular to the smoke rings, forming two hourglass-shaped structures. These structures are expanding rapidly at more than half-a-million miles per hour (240 km/s). \"The discovery that this process can involve ejections of rings of gas, simultaneous with the production of high-speed intermittent jets of material, brings a new and fascinating wrinkle to our understanding of how stars end their lives,\u201d Morris said . All of this suggests that the star is undergoing a particularly rapid evolution, which runs counter to the current model. \"Our study dramatically reveals that the traditional model of how AGB stars die\u2014through the mass ejection of fuel via a slow, relatively steady spherical wind over 100,000 years or more\u2014is at best incomplete, or at worst, incorrect,\" said Sahai . \u201cIt is very likely that a close stellar or substellar companion plays a significant role in their deaths. In the case of V Hya, the combination of a nearby and a hypothetical distant companion star is responsible, at least to some degree, for the presence of its six rings, and the high-speed outflows that are causing the star\u2019s miraculous death.\u201d",
